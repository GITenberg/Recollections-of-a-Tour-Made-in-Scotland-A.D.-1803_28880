ix</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Those who have long known the poetry of Wordsworth will be no
strangers to the existence of this Journal of his sister, which
is now for the first time published entire.&nbsp; They will have
by heart those few wonderful sentences from it which here and
there stand at the head of the Poet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memorials of a
Tour in Scotland in 1803.&rsquo;&nbsp; Especially they will
remember that &lsquo;Extract from the Journal of my
Companion&rsquo; which preludes the &lsquo;Address to Kilchurn
Castle upon Loch Awe,&rsquo; and they may sometimes have asked
themselves whether the prose of the sister is not as truly poetic
and as memorable as her brother&rsquo;s verse.&nbsp; If they have
read the Memoirs of the Poet published by his nephew the Bishop
of Lincoln, they will have found there fuller extracts from the
Journal, which quite maintain the impression made by the first
brief sentences.&nbsp; All true Wordsworthians then will welcome,
I believe, the present publication.&nbsp; They will find in it
not only new and illustrative light on those Scottish poems which
they have so long known, but a faithful commentary on the
character of the poet, his mode of life, and the manner of his
poetry.&nbsp; Those who from close study of Wordsworth&rsquo;s
poetry know both the poet and his sister, and what they were to
each other, will need nothing more than the Journal itself.&nbsp;
If <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>it were likely to fall only into their hands, it might be
left without one word of comment or illustration.&nbsp; But as it
may reach some who have never read Wordsworth, and others who
having read do not relish him, for the information of these
something more must be said.&nbsp; The Journal now published does
not borrow all its worth from its bearing on the great
poet.&nbsp; It has merit and value of its own, which may commend
it to some who have no heart for Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp;
For the writer of it was in herself no common woman, and might
have secured for herself an independent reputation, had she not
chosen rather that other part, to forget and merge herself
entirely in the work and reputation of her brother.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy Wordsworth</span> was the only
sister of the poet, a year and a half younger, having been born
on Christmas Day 1771.&nbsp; The five children who composed the
family, four sons and one daughter, lost their mother in 1778,
when William was eight, and Dorothy six years old.&nbsp; The
father died five years afterwards, at the close of 1783, and the
family home at Cockermouth was broken up and the children
scattered.&nbsp; Before his father&rsquo;s death, William, in his
ninth year, had gone with his elder brother to school at
Hawkshead, by the lake of Esthwaite, and after the father died
Dorothy was brought up by a cousin on her mother&rsquo;s side,
Miss Threlkeld, afterwards Mrs. Rawson, who lived in
Halifax.&nbsp; During the eight years which Wordsworth spent at
school, or, at any rate, from the time of his father&rsquo;s
death, he and his sister seem seldom, if ever, to have met.</p>
<p>The first college vacation in the summer of 1788 brought him
back to his old school in the vale of Esthwaite, and either this
or the next of his undergraduate summers <!-- page xi--><a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>restored him
to the society of his sister at Penrith.&nbsp; This meeting is
thus described in the &lsquo;Prelude:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;In summer, making quest for works of
art, <br />
Or scenes renowned for beauty, I explored<br />
That streamlet whose blue current works its way <br />
Between romantic Dovedale&rsquo;s spiry rocks; <br />
Pried into Yorkshire dales, or hidden tracts <br />
Of my own native region, and was blest <br />
Between these sundry wanderings with a joy <br />
Above all joys, that seemed another morn<br />
Risen on mid-noon; blest with the presence, Friend!&nbsp; <br />
Of that sole sister, her who hath been long <br />
Dear to thee also, thy true friend and mine, <br />
Now, after separation desolate<br />
Restored to me&mdash;such absence that she seemed <br />
A gift then first bestowed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They then together wandered by the banks of Emont, among the
woods of Lowther, and &lsquo;climbing the Border Beacon looked
wistfully towards the dim regions of Scotland.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
and there too Wordsworth first met that young kinswoman who was
his wife to be.</p>
<p>During the following summers the Poet was busy with walking
tours in Switzerland and North Italy, his residence in France,
his absorption in the French Revolution, which kept him some
years longer apart from his sister.&nbsp; During those years Miss
Wordsworth lived much with her uncle Dr. Cookson, who was a canon
of Windsor and a favourite with the Court, and there met with
people of more learning and refinement, but not of greater worth,
than those she had left in her northern home.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1794 Wordsworth, returned from his
wanderings, came to visit his sister at Halifax, his head still
in a whirl with revolutionary fervours.&nbsp; He was wandering
about among his friends with no certain <!-- page xii--><a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xii</span>dwelling-place, no fixed plan of life, his practical
purposes and his opinions, political, philosophical, and
religious, all alike at sea.&nbsp; But whatever else might remain
unsettled, the bread-and-butter question, as Coleridge calls it,
could not.&nbsp; The thought of orders, for which his friends
intended him, had been abandoned; law he abominated; writing for
the newspaper press seemed the only resource.&nbsp; In this
seething state of mind he sought once more his sister&rsquo;s
calming society, and the two travelled together on foot from
Kendal to Grasmere, from Grasmere to Keswick, &lsquo;through the
most delightful country that was ever seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Towards the close of this year (1794) Wordsworth would
probably have gone to London to take up the trade of a writer for
the newspapers.&nbsp; From this however he was held back for a
time by the duty of nursing his friend Raisley Calvert, who lay
dying at Penrith.&nbsp; Early in 1795 the young man died, leaving
to his friend, the young Poet, a legacy of &pound;900.&nbsp; The
world did not then hold Wordsworth for a poet, and had received
with coldness his first attempt, &lsquo;Descriptive Sketches and
an Evening Walk,&rsquo; published two years before.&nbsp; But the
dying youth had seen further than the world, and felt convinced
that his friend, if he had leisure given him to put forth his
powers, would do something which would make the world his
debtor.&nbsp; With this view he bequeathed him the small sum
above named.&nbsp; And seldom has such a bequest borne ampler
fruit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Upon the interest of the &pound;900,
&pound;400 being laid out in annuity, with &pound;200 deducted
from the principal, and &pound;100 a legacy to my sister, and
&pound;100 more which &ldquo;The Lyrical Ballads&rdquo; have
brought me, my sister and I have contrived to live seven years,
nearly eight.&rsquo;&nbsp; So wrote Wordsworth in 1805 to his
friend Sir George <!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>Beaumont.&nbsp; Thus at this
juncture of the Poet&rsquo;s fate, when to onlookers he must have
seemed both outwardly and inwardly well-nigh bankrupt, Raisley
Calvert&rsquo;s bequest came to supply his material needs, and to
his inward needs his sister became the best earthly
minister.&nbsp; For his mind was ill at ease.&nbsp; The high
hopes awakened in him by the French Revolution had been dashed,
and his spirit, darkened and depressed, was on the verge of
despair.&nbsp; He might have become such a man as he has pictured
in the character of &lsquo;The Solitary.&rsquo;&nbsp; But a good
Providence brought his sister to his side and saved him.&nbsp;
She discerned his real need and divined the remedy.&nbsp; By her
cheerful society, fine tact, and vivid love for nature she turned
him, depressed and bewildered, alike from the abstract
speculations and the contemporary politics in which he had got
immersed, and directed his thoughts towards truth of poetry, and
the face of nature, and the healing that for him lay in
these.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Then
it was<br />
That the beloved sister in whose sight <br />
Those days were passed&mdash;<br />
Maintained for me a saving intercourse<br />
With my true self; for though bedimmed and changed <br />
Much, as it seemed, I was no further changed <br />
Than as a clouded or a waning moon: <br />
She whispered still that brightness would return, <br />
She, in the midst of all, preserved me still <br />
A Poet, made me seek beneath that name, <br />
And that alone, my office upon earth.</p>
<p>By intercourse with her and wanderings together in delightful
places of his native country, he was gradually led back</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;To those sweet counsels between head and
heart<br />
Whence genuine knowledge grew.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>The brother and sister, having thus cast in their lots
together, settled at Racedown Lodge in Dorsetshire in the autumn
of 1795.&nbsp; They had there a pleasant house, with a good
garden, and around them charming walks and a delightful country
looking out on the distant sea.&nbsp; The place was very retired,
with little or no society, and the post only once a week.&nbsp;
But of employment there was no lack.&nbsp; The brother now
settled steadily to poetic work; the sister engaged in household
duties and reading, and then when work was over, there were
endless walks and wanderings.&nbsp; Long years afterwards Miss
Wordsworth spoke of Racedown as the place she looked back to with
most affection.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the
first home I had.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poems which Wordsworth there composed were not among his
best,&mdash;&lsquo;The Borderers,&rsquo; &lsquo;Guilt or
Sorrow,&rsquo; and others.&nbsp; He was yet only groping to find
his true subjects and his own proper manner.&nbsp; But there was
one piece there composed which will stand comparison with any
tale he ever wrote.&nbsp; It was &lsquo;The Ruined
Cottage,&rsquo; which, under the title of the &lsquo;Story of
Margaret,&rsquo; he afterwards incorporated in the first Book of
&lsquo;The Excursion.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was when they had been
nearly two years at Racedown that they received a guest who was
destined to exercise more influence on the self-contained
Wordsworth than any other man ever did.&nbsp; This was S. T.
Coleridge.&nbsp; One can imagine how he would talk, interrupted
only by their mutually reading aloud their respective Tragedies,
both of which are now well-nigh forgotten, and by Wordsworth
reading his &lsquo;Ruined Cottage,&rsquo; which is not
forgotten.&nbsp; Miss Wordsworth describes S. T. C., as he then
was, in words that are well known.&nbsp; And he describes her
thus, in words less known,&mdash;&lsquo;She is a woman indeed, in
mind I <!-- page xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xv</span>mean, and in heart; for her person is
such that if you expected to see a pretty woman, you would think
her ordinary; if you expected to see an ordinary woman, you would
think her pretty, but her manners are simple, ardent,
impressive.&nbsp; In every motion her innocent soul out-beams so
brightly, that who saw her would say, &ldquo;Guilt was a thing
impossible with her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her information various, her
eye watchful in minutest observation of nature, and her taste a
perfect electrometer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The result of this meeting of the two poets was that the
Wordsworths shifted their abode from Racedown to Alfoxden, near
Nether Stowey, in Somersetshire, to be near Coleridge.&nbsp;
Alfoxden was a large furnished mansion, which the brother and
sister had to themselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are three miles from
Stowey, the then abode of Coleridge,&rsquo; writes the sister,
&lsquo;and two miles from the sea.&nbsp; Wherever we turn we have
woods, smooth downs, and valleys, with small brooks running down
them, through green meadows, hardly ever intersected with
hedgerows, but scattered over with trees.&nbsp; The hills that
cradle these valleys are either covered with fern and bilberries,
or oak woods, which are cut for charcoal.&nbsp; Walks extend for
miles over the hill-tops, the great beauty of which is their wild
simplicity&mdash;they are perfectly smooth, without
rocks.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was in this neighbourhood, as the two
poets loitered in the silvan combs or walked along the smooth
Quantock hill-tops, looking seaward, with the &lsquo;sole
sister,&rsquo; the companion of their walks, that they struck
each from the other his finest tones.&nbsp; It was with both of
them the heyday of poetic creation.&nbsp; In these walks it was
that Coleridge, with slight hints from Wordsworth, first chaunted
the vision of the Ancient Mariner, and then alone, &lsquo;The
rueful woes of Lady <!-- page xvi--><a name="pagexvi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>Christabel.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, too,
was the birthday of some of the finest of the Lyrical Ballads, of
&lsquo;We are seven,&rsquo; &lsquo;Simon Lee,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Expostulation and Reply,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Tables
Turned,&rsquo; &lsquo;It is the first mild day in March,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;I heard a thousand blended notes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Coleridge never knew again such a season of poetic creation, and
Wordsworth&rsquo;s tardier, if stronger, nature, received from
contact with Coleridge that quickening impulse which it needed,
and which it retained during all its most creative years.</p>
<p>But if Coleridge, with his occasional intercourse and
wonderful talk, did much for Wordsworth, his sister, by her
continual companionship, did far more.&nbsp; After the great
revulsion from the excesses of the French Revolution, she was
with him a continually sanative influence.&nbsp; That whole
period, which ranged from 1795 till his settling at Grasmere at
the opening of the next century, and of which the residence at
Racedown and Alfoxden formed a large part, was the healing time
of his spirit.&nbsp; And in that healing time she was the chief
human minister.&nbsp; Somewhere in the &lsquo;Prelude&rsquo; he
tells that in early youth there was a too great sternness of
spirit about him, a high but too severe moral ideal by which he
judged men and things, insensible to gentler and humbler
influences.&nbsp; He compares his soul to a high, bare craig,
without any crannies in which flowers may lurk, untouched by the
mellowing influences of sun and shower.&nbsp; His sister came
with her softening influence, and sowed in it the needed flowers,
and touched it with mellowing colours:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;She gave me eyes, she gave me ears,<br
/>
And humble cares and delicate fears,<br />
A heart, the fountain of sweet tears<br />
And love, and thought and joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page xvii--><a name="pagexvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>Elsewhere in the
&lsquo;Prelude&rsquo; he describes how at one time his soul had
got too much under the dominion of the eye, so that he kept
comparing scene with scene, instead of enjoying each for
itself&mdash;craving new forms, novelties of colour or
proportion, and insensible to the spirit of each place and the
affections which each awakens.&nbsp; In contrast with this
temporary mood of his own he turns to one of another
temper:&mdash;</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I
knew a maid,<br />
A young enthusiast who escaped these bonds,<br />
Her eye was not the mistress of her heart,<br />
She welcomed what was given, and craved no more;<br />
Whate&rsquo;er the scene presented to her view,<br />
That was the best, to that she was attuned<br />
By her benign simplicity of life.<br />
Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field,<br />
Could they have known her, would have loved; methought<br />
Her very presence such a sweetness breathed,<br />
That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,<br />
And everything she looked on, should have had<br />
An intimation how she bore herself<br />
Towards them and to all creatures.&nbsp; God delights<br />
In such a being; for her common thoughts<br />
Are piety, her life is gratitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But it was not his sister the Poet speaks of here, but of his
first meeting with her who afterwards became his wife.</p>
<p>The results of the residence at Racedown, but especially at
Alfoxden, appeared in the shape of the first volume of the
&lsquo;Lyrical Ballads,&rsquo; which were published in the autumn
of 1798 by Mr. Cottle at Bristol.&nbsp; This small volume opens
with Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Rime of the Ancyent
Marinere,&rsquo; and is followed by Wordsworth&rsquo;s short but
exquisite poems of the Alfoxden time, and is closed by the
well-known lines on Tintern Abbey.&nbsp; Wordsworth reaches about
the <!-- page xviii--><a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>highest pitch of his inspiration
in this latter poem, which contains more rememberable lines than
any other of his, of equal length, save perhaps the Immortality
Ode.&nbsp; It was the result of a ramble of four or five days
made by him and his sister from Alfoxden in July 1798, and was
composed under circumstances &lsquo;most pleasant,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;for me to remember.&rsquo;&nbsp; He began it upon
leaving Tintern, after crossing the Wye, and concluded it as he
was entering Bristol in the evening.</p>
<p>Every one will recollect how, after its high reflections he
turns at the close to her, &lsquo;his dearest Friend,&rsquo;
&lsquo;his dear, dear Friend,&rsquo; and speaks of his delight to
have her by his side, and of the former pleasures which he read
in &lsquo;the shooting lights of her wild eyes,&rsquo; and then
the almost prophetic words with which he forebodes, too surely,
that time when &lsquo;solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief should
be her portion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That September (1798) saw the break-up of the brief, bright
companionship near Nether Stowey.&nbsp; Coleridge went with
Wordsworth and his sister to Germany, but soon parted from them
and passed on alone to G&ouml;ttingen, there to study German, and
lose himself in the labyrinth of German metaphysics.&nbsp;
Wordsworth and Dorothy remained at Goslar, and, making no
acquaintances, spent the winter&mdash;said to have been the
coldest of the century&mdash;by the German stoves, Wordsworth
writing more lyrical poems in the same vein which had been opened
so happily at Alfoxden.&nbsp; There is in these poems no tincture
of their German surroundings; they deal entirely with those which
they had left on English ground.&nbsp; Early in spring they
returned to England, to spend the summer with their friends the
Hutchinsons at Sockburn-upon-Tees.&nbsp; <!-- page xix--><a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>There
Dorothy remained, while in September Wordsworth made with
Coleridge the walking tour through the lakes of Westmoreland and
Cumberland, which issued in his choice of a home at Grasmere for
himself and his sister.</p>
<p>At the close of the year Wordsworth and his sister set off and
walked, driven forward by the cold, frosty winds blowing from
behind, from Wensleydale over Sedbergh&rsquo;s naked heights and
the high range that divides the Yorkshire dales from the lake
country.&nbsp; On the shortest day of the year (St.
Thomas&rsquo;s Day) they reached the small two-story cottage at
the Townend of Grasmere, which, for the next eight years, was to
be the poet&rsquo;s home, immortalised by the work he did in
it.&nbsp; That cottage has behind it a small orchard-plot or
garden ground shelving upwards toward the woody mountains above,
and in front it looks across the peaceful lake with its one green
island, to the steeps of Silver-how on the farther side.&nbsp;
Westward it looks on Helm Craig, and up the long folds of
Easedale towards the range that divides Easedale from
Borrowdale.&nbsp; In this cottage they two lived on their income
of a hundred pounds a year, Dorothy doing all the household work,
for they had then, it has been said, no servant.&nbsp; Besides
this, she had time to write out all his poems&mdash;for
Wordsworth himself could never bear the strain of
transcribing&mdash;to read aloud to him of an afternoon or
evening&mdash;at one such reading by her of Milton&rsquo;s
Sonnets it was that his soul took fire and rolled off his first
sonnets&mdash;and to accompany him on his endless walks.&nbsp;
Nor these alone&mdash;her eye and imagination fed him, not only
with subjects for his poetry, but even with images and
thoughts.&nbsp; What we are told of the poem of the
&lsquo;Beggars&rsquo; might be said of I know not how many
more.&nbsp; <!-- page xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xx</span>&lsquo;The sister&rsquo;s eye was
ever on the watch to provide for the poet&rsquo;s
pen.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had a most observant eye, and she also for
him; and his poems are sometimes little more than poetic versions
of her descriptions of the objects which she had seen; and which
he treated as seen by himself.&nbsp; Look at the poem on the
&lsquo;Daffodils&rsquo; and compare with it these words taken
from the sister&rsquo;s Journal.&nbsp; &lsquo;When we were in the
woods below Gowbarrow Park, we saw a few daffodils close by the
water-side.&nbsp; As we went along there were more and yet more;
and at last, under the boughs of the trees, we saw there were a
long belt of them along the shore.&nbsp; I never saw daffodils so
beautiful.&nbsp; They grew among the mossy stones about
them.&nbsp; Some rested their heads on the stones, as on a
pillow; the rest tossed, and reeled, and danced, and seemed as if
they verily laughed with the wind, they looked so gay and
glancing.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may also be noted that the Poet&rsquo;s
future wife contributed to this poem these two best
lines&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;They flash upon that inward eye,<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Or take another description from Miss Wordsworth&rsquo;s
Journal of a birch-tree, &lsquo;the lady of the woods,&rsquo;
which her brother has not versified:&mdash;&lsquo;As we were
going along we were stopped at once, at the distance, perhaps, of
fifty yards from our favourite birch-tree: it was yielding to the
gust of the wind, with all its tender twigs; the sun shone upon
it, and it glanced in the wind like a flying sunshiny
shower.&nbsp; It was a tree in shape, with stem and branches, but
it was like a spirit of water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The life which the Poet and his sister lived during the eight
years at the Townend of Grasmere stands out with <!-- page
xxi--><a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>a
marked individuality which it is delightful ever so often to
recur to.&nbsp; It was as unlike the lives of most literary or
other men, as the most original of his poems are unlike the
ordinary run of even good poetry.&nbsp; Their outward life was
exactly like that of the dalesmen or
&lsquo;statesmen&rsquo;&mdash;for so the native yeomen
proprietors are called&mdash;with whom they lived on the most
friendly footing, and among whom they found their chief
society.&nbsp; Outwardly their life was so, but inwardly it was
cheered by imaginative visitings to which these were
strangers.&nbsp; Sheltered as they then were from the agitations
of the world, the severe frugality of the life they led
ministered in more than one way to feed that poetry which
introduced a new element into English thought.&nbsp; It kept the
mind cool, and the eye clear, to feel once more that kinship
between the outward world and the soul of man, to perceive that
impassioned expression in the countenance of all nature, which,
if felt by primeval men, ages of cultivation have long
forgotten.&nbsp; It also made them wise to practise the same
frugality in emotional enjoyment which they exercised in
household economy.&nbsp; It has been well noted <a
name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a> that this is one of Wordsworth&rsquo;s
chief characteristics.&nbsp; It is the temptation of the poetic
temperament to be prodigal of passion, to demand a life always
strung to the highest pitch of emotional excitement, to be never
content unless when passing from fervour to fervour.&nbsp; No
life can long endure this strain.&nbsp; This is specially seen in
such poets as Byron and Shelley, who speedily fell from the
heights of passion to the depths of languor and
despondency.&nbsp; The same quick using up of the power of
enjoyment produces the too common product of the <!-- page
xxii--><a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span><i>blas&eacute;</i> man and the cynic.&nbsp;
Wordsworth early perceived that all, even the richest, natures
have but a very limited capacity of uninterrupted enjoyment, and
that nothing is easier than to exhaust this capacity.&nbsp; Hence
he set himself to husband it, to draw upon it sparingly, to
employ it only on the purest, most natural, and most enduring
objects, and not to speedily dismiss or throw them by and demand
more, but to detain them till they had yielded him their
utmost.&nbsp; From this in part it came that the commonest sights
of earth and sky&mdash;a fine spring day, a sunset, even a chance
traveller met on a moor, any ordinary sorrow of man&rsquo;s
life&mdash;yielded to him an amount of imaginative interest
inconceivable to more mundane spirits.&nbsp; The simple
healthiness and strict frugality of his household life suited
well, and must have greatly assisted, that wholesome frugality of
emotion which he exercised.</p>
<p>During those seven or eight Grasmere years, the spring of
poetry which burst forth at Alfoxden, and produced the first
volume of &lsquo;Lyrical Ballads,&rsquo; flowed steadily on and
found expression in other poems of like quality and
spirit,&mdash;&lsquo;Hartleap Well,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Brothers,&rsquo; &lsquo;Michael,&rsquo; which, with others of the
same order, written in Germany, appeared in the second volume of
&lsquo;Lyrical Ballads.&rsquo;&nbsp; And after these two volumes
had gone forth, Grasmere still gave more of the same high
order,&mdash;&lsquo;The Daffodils,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
Leech-Gatherer,&rsquo; and above all the &lsquo;Ode on
Immortality.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was too the conclusion of the
&lsquo;Prelude,&rsquo; and the beginning of the
&lsquo;Excursion.&rsquo;&nbsp; So that it may be said that those
Grasmere years, from 1800 to 1807, mark the period when
Wordsworth&rsquo;s genius was in its zenith.&nbsp; During all
this time, sister Dorothy was by his side, ministering to him,
equally in body and in mind&mdash;doing the part of household
servant, <!-- page xxiii--><a name="pagexxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>and not less that of prompter and
inspirer of his highest songs.</p>
<p>But this life of theirs, retired and uneventful as it seems,
was not without its own incidents.&nbsp; Such was the homecoming
of their younger sailor-brother John, who, in the first year of
their residence at Grasmere&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Under their cottage roof, had gladly
come<br />
From the wild sea a cherished visitant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was, what his brother calls him, &lsquo;a silent
poet,&rsquo; and had the heart and sense to feel the sterling
quality of his brother&rsquo;s poems, and to foretell with
perfect confidence their ultimate acceptance, at the time when
the critic wits who ruled the hour treated them with
contempt.&nbsp; The two brothers were congenial spirits, and
William&rsquo;s poetry has many affecting allusions to his
brother John, whose intention it was, when his last voyage was
over, to settle in &lsquo;Grasmere&rsquo;s happy vale,&rsquo; and
to devote the surplus of his fortune to his brother&rsquo;s
use.&nbsp; On his last voyage he sailed as captain of the
&lsquo;Earl of Abergavenny&rsquo; East-Indiaman, at the opening
of February 1805; and on the 5th of that month, the ill-fated
ship struck on the Shambles of the Bill of Portland, and the
captain and most of the crew went down with her.&nbsp; To the
brother and sister this became a permanent household
sorrow.&nbsp; But in time they found comfort in that thought with
which the Poet closes a remarkable letter on his brother&rsquo;s
loss,&mdash;&lsquo;So good must be better; so high must be
destined to be higher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another lesser incident was a short tour to the Continent, in
which, as the brother and sister crossed Westminster Bridge,
outside the Dover coach, both witnessed that sunrise which
remains fixed for ever in the famous sonnet.&nbsp; <!-- page
xxiv--><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiv</span>Another incident, and more important, was
Wordsworth&rsquo;s marriage in October 1802, when he brought home
his young wife, Mary Hutchinson, his sister&rsquo;s long-time
friend, to their cottage at Townend.&nbsp; This is she whom he
has sung in the lines&mdash;&lsquo;She was a phantom of
delight;&rsquo; of whom he said in plain prose, &lsquo;She has a
sweetness all but angelic, simplicity the most entire, womanly
self-respect and purity of heart speaking through all her looks,
acts, and movements.&rsquo;&nbsp; The advent of Mrs. Wordsworth
brought no change to Dorothy.&nbsp; She still continued to fill
to her brother and his wife the same place which she had filled
when her brother was alone, sharing in all the household duties
and family interests, and still accompanying him in his rambles
when Mrs. Wordsworth was detained at home.&nbsp; The year after
the marriage, that is, in the fourth year of the Grasmere
residence, after the first son was born, the brother and sister,
accompanied by Coleridge, set out on that tour the Journal of
which is here published.&nbsp; Portions of it have already
appeared in the &lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo; of Wordsworth, but it is
now for the first time given in full, just as it came from the
pen of Miss Wordsworth seventy years ago.&nbsp; As I shall have
to speak of it again, I may now pass on and note the few facts
that still remain to be told in illustration of the
writer&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>In the years which followed the tour in Scotland, other
children were added to Wordsworth&rsquo;s family, till the small
cottage at the Townend could no longer accommodate the
household.&nbsp; The second child was the poet&rsquo;s only
daughter, whom after his sister he called Dorothy, generally
known as Dora, for, as he tells Lady Beaumont, he could not find
it in his heart to call her by another name.&nbsp; This second
Dora occupies in Wordsworth&rsquo;s later poetry the same <!--
page xxv--><a name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxv</span>place which the first Dorothy held in his
earlier.&nbsp; Aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s love, as it expanded to take
in each newcomer, did not lose any of its intensity towards her
brother.&nbsp; While the uneasiness which the act of writing had
always occasioned him was not diminished, weakness of eyesight
increased.&nbsp; Then she had to write for him, she read to him,
she walked with him as of old, besides sharing in all household
cares.&nbsp; In November 1806, Wordsworth removed with his family
to Coleorton, in Leicestershire, to spend the winter there in a
house of Sir George Beaumont&rsquo;s; &lsquo;Our own
cottage,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;being far too small for our
family to winter in, though we manage well enough in it during
the summer.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the spring of 1807, Wordsworth and
his wife visited London.&nbsp; Dorothy, who was left with the
children, wrote the poem called &lsquo;The Mother&rsquo;s
Return,&rsquo; as a welcome to Mrs. Wordsworth when she came
back.&nbsp; This with two other poems, written by her for the
children, one on &lsquo;The Wind,&rsquo; the other called
&lsquo;The Cottager to her Infant,&rsquo; afterwards appeared in
an edition of her brother&rsquo;s poems.</p>
<p>This seems the proper place to give the account of Miss
Wordsworth, as she appeared to De Quincey, when in 1807 he first
made the acquaintance of Wordsworth, just before the Poet and his
family quitted their old home in the cottage at Grasmere
Townend.&nbsp; After speaking of Mrs. Wordsworth, he
continues:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Immediately behind her moved a lady, shorter, slighter,
and perhaps, in all other respects, as different from her in
personal characteristics as could have been wished for the most
effective contrast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her face was of Egyptian
brown;&rdquo; rarely, in a woman of English birth, had I seen a
more determinate gipsy tan.&nbsp; Her eyes were not soft as <!--
page xxvi--><a name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvi</span>Mrs. Wordsworth&rsquo;s, nor were they fierce or bold;
but they were wild and startling, and hurried in their
motion.&nbsp; Her manner was warm, and even ardent; her
sensibility seemed constitutionally deep; and some subtle fire of
impassioned intellect apparently burned within her,
which&mdash;being alternately pushed forward into a conspicuous
expression by the irresistible instincts of her temperament, and
then immediately checked in obedience to the decorum of her sex
and age and her maidenly condition&mdash;gave to her whole
demeanour, and to her conversation, an air of embarrassment, and
even of self-conflict, that was almost distressing to
witness.&nbsp; Even her very utterance and enunciation often
suffered in point of clearness and steadiness, from the agitation
of her excessive organic sensibility.&nbsp; At times the
self-counteraction and self-baffling of her feelings caused her
even to stammer.&nbsp; But the greatest deductions from Miss
Wordsworth&rsquo;s attractions, and from the exceeding interest
which surrounded her, in right of her character, of her history,
and of the relation which she fulfilled towards her brother, were
the glancing quickness of her motions, and other circumstances in
her deportment (such as her stooping attitude when walking),
which gave an ungraceful character to her appearance when out of
doors . . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her knowledge of literature was irregular and
thoroughly unsystematic.&nbsp; She was content to be ignorant of
many things; but what she knew, and had really mastered, lay
where it could not be disturbed&mdash;in the temple of her own
most fervid heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may not be amiss here to add from the same gossipy but
graphic pen, a description of the Townend home, and of the way of
life there, which has often before been quoted:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page xxvii--><a name="pagexxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>&lsquo;A little semi-vestibule
between two doors prefaced the entrance into what might be
considered the principal room of the cottage.&nbsp; It was an
oblong square, not above eight and a half feet high, sixteen feet
long, and twelve broad, very prettily wainscoted from the floor
to the ceiling with dark polished oak, slightly embellished with
carving.&nbsp; One window there was&mdash;a perfect and
unpretending cottage window&mdash;with little diamond panes,
embowered at almost every season of the year with roses, and, in
the summer and autumn, with a profusion of jasmine and other
fragrant shrubs.&nbsp; From the exuberant luxuriance of the
vegetation around it, this window, though tolerably large, did
not furnish a very powerful light to one who entered from the
open air . . . .&nbsp; I was ushered up a little flight of
stairs, fourteen in all, to a little drawing-room, or whatever
the reader chooses to call it.&nbsp; Wordsworth himself has
described the fireplace of this room as his</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Half kitchen, and half parlour
fire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not fully seven feet six inches high, and in other
respects pretty nearly of the same dimensions as the rustic hall
below.&nbsp; There was, however, in a small recess, a library of
perhaps three hundred volumes, which seemed to consecrate this
room as the poet&rsquo;s study and composing-room, and such
occasionally it was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About four o&rsquo;clock it might be when we
arrived.&nbsp; At that hour in November the daylight soon
declined, and in an hour and a half we were all collected about
the tea-table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This with the Wordsworths, under the simple rustic
system of habits which they cherished then and for twenty <!--
page xxviii--><a name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxviii</span>years after, was the most delightful meal of the
day, just as dinner is in great cities, and for the same reason,
because it was prolonged into a meal of leisure and
conversation.&nbsp; That night I found myself, about eleven at
night, in a pretty bedroom, about fourteen feet by twelve.&nbsp;
Much I feared that this might turn out the best room in the
house; and it illustrates the hospitality of my new friends to
mention that it was . . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next morning Miss Wordsworth I found making breakfast
in the little sitting-room.&nbsp; No one was there, no glittering
breakfast service; a kettle boiled upon the fire; and everything
was in harmony with these unpretending arrangements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I rarely had seen so humble a <i>m&eacute;nage</i>;
and, contrasting the dignity of the man with this honourable
poverty, and this courageous avowal of it, his utter absence of
all effort to disguise the simple truth of the case, I felt my
admiration increased.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Throughout the day, which was rainy, the same style of
modest hospitality prevailed.&nbsp; Wordsworth and his sister,
myself being of the party, walked out in spite of the rain, and
made the circuit of the two lakes, Grasmere and its dependency
Rydal, a walk of about six miles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the third morning after my arrival in Grasmere, I
found the whole family, except the two children, prepared for the
expedition across the mountains.&nbsp; I had heard of no horses,
and took it for granted that we were to walk; however, at the
moment of starting, a cart, the common farmer&rsquo;s cart of the
country, made its appearance, and the driver was a bonny young
woman of the vale.&nbsp; Accordingly we were all carted along to
the little town or large village of Ambleside, three and a half
miles distant.&nbsp; Our <!-- page xxix--><a
name="pagexxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>style of
travelling occasioned no astonishment; on the contrary, we met a
smiling salutation wherever we appeared; Miss Wordsworth being,
as I observed, the person most familiarly known of our party, and
the one who took upon herself the whole expenses of the flying
colloquies exchanged with stragglers on the road.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the family had to leave this cottage home at Townend,
they migrated to Allan Bank in 1808, and there remained for three
years.&nbsp; In the spring of 1811 they moved to the Parsonage of
Grasmere, and thence, in the spring of 1813, to Rydal Mount,
their final abode.&nbsp; Their sojourn in the Parsonage was
saddened by the loss of two children, who died within six months
of each other, and were laid side by side in the churchyard of
Grasmere.&nbsp; The Parsonage looks right across the road on that
burial-place, and the continual sight of this was more than they
could bear.&nbsp; They were glad therefore to withdraw from it,
and to exchange the vale of Grasmere, now filled for them with
too mournful recollections, for the sweet retirement of
Rydal.</p>
<p>Through all these changes sister Dorothy went of course with
them, and shared the affliction of the bereaved parents, as she
had formerly shared their happiness.&nbsp; In 1814, the year of
the publication of the &lsquo;Excursion,&rsquo; all of which Miss
Wordsworth had transcribed, her brother made another tour in
Scotland, and this time Yarrow was not unvisited.&nbsp; His wife
and her sister went with him, but Dorothy, having stayed at home
probably to tend the children, did not form one of the party, a
circumstance which her brother always remembered with regret.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1820, however, she visited the Continent with
her brother and Mrs. Wordsworth, but of this <!-- page xxx--><a
name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>tour no
record remains.&nbsp; Another visit, the last but one, Wordsworth
made to Scotland in 1831, accompanied by his daughter Dora.&nbsp;
This time Yarrow was revisited in company with Sir Walter Scott,
just before his last going from Tweedside.&nbsp; Wordsworth has
chronicled his parting with Scott in two affecting poems, which
if any reader does not know by heart, I would recommend him to
read them in the Appendix to this Journal. <a
name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a></p>
<p>But by the time this expedition was made, Dorothy was an
invalid confined to a sick-room.&nbsp; In the year 1829 she was
seized by a severe illness, which so prostrated her, body and
mind, that she never recovered from it.&nbsp; The unceasing
strain of years had at last worn out that buoyant frame and
fervid spirit.&nbsp; She had given herself to one work, and that
work was done.&nbsp; To some it may seem a commonplace
one,&mdash;to live in and for her brother, to do by him a
sister&rsquo;s duty.&nbsp; With original powers which, had she
chosen to set up on her own account, might have won for her high
literary fame, she was content to forget herself, to merge all
her gifts and all her interests in those of her brother.&nbsp;
She thus made him other and higher than he could have been had he
stood alone, and enabled him to render better service to the
world than without her ministry he could have done.&nbsp; With
this she was well content.&nbsp; It is sad to think that when the
world at last knew him for what he was, the great original poet
of this century, she who had helped to make him so was almost
past rejoicing in it.&nbsp; It is said that during those latter
years he never spoke of her without his voice being sensibly
softened and saddened.&nbsp; The return of the day when they two
first came to Grasmere was to him a solemn <!-- page xxxi--><a
name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxi</span>anniversary.&nbsp; But though so enfeebled, she still
lived on, and survived her brother by nearly five years.&nbsp;
Her death took place at Rydal Mount in January 1855, at the age
of eighty-three.&nbsp; And now, beside her brother and his wife
and others of that household, she rests in the green Grasmere
churchyard, with the clear waters of Rotha murmuring by.</p>
<p>To return to the Journal.&nbsp; As we read it, let us bear
always in mind that it was not meant for us, for the world, or
&lsquo;the general reader,&rsquo; but to be listened to by a
small family circle, gathered round the winter fire.&nbsp; We
should therefore remember that in reading it we are, as it were,
allowed, after seventy years, to overhear what was not primarily
meant for our ears at all.&nbsp; This will account for a fulness
and minuteness of detail which to unsympathetic persons may
perhaps appear tedious.&nbsp; But the writer was telling her
story, not for unsympathetic persons, not for &lsquo;general
readers,&rsquo; much less for literary critics, but for
&lsquo;the household hearts that were her own,&rsquo; on whose
sympathy she could reckon, even down to the minutest
circumstances of this journey.&nbsp; And so there is no attempt
at fine or sensational writing, as we now call it, no attempt at
that modern artifice which they call word-painting.&nbsp; But
there is the most absolute sincerity, the most perfect fidelity
to her own experience, the most single-minded endeavour to set
down precisely the things they saw and heard and felt, just as
they saw and felt and heard them, while moving on their quiet
way.&nbsp; And hence perhaps the observant reader who submits
himself to the spirit that pervades this Journal may find in its
effortless narrative a truthfulness, a tenderness of observation,
a &lsquo;vivid exactness,&rsquo; a far-reaching and suggestive
insight, <!-- page xxxii--><a name="pagexxxii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>for which he might look in vain in
more studied productions.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is the historic value that now attaches
to this Journal.&nbsp; It marks the state of Scotland, and the
feeling with which the most finely gifted Englishmen came to it
seventy years since, at a time before the flood of English
interest and &lsquo;tourism&rsquo; had set in across the
Border.&nbsp; The Wordsworths were of course not average English
people.&nbsp; They came with an eye awake and trained for nature,
and a heart in sympathy with nature and with man in a degree not
common either in that or in any other age.&nbsp; They were
north-country English too, and between these and the Lowland
Scots there was less difference of fibre and of feeling than
there generally is between Cumbrians and Londoners.&nbsp; All
their lives they had been wont to gaze across the Solway on the
dimly-outlined mountains of the Scottish Border.&nbsp; This alone
and their love of scenery and of wandering were enough, apart
from other inducement, to have lured them northward.&nbsp; But
that tide of sentiment, which in our day has culminated in our
annual tourist inundation, was already setting in.&nbsp; It had
been growing ever since &lsquo;The Forty-five,&rsquo; when the
sudden descent of the Highland host on England, arrested only by
the disastrous pause at Derby, had frightened the Londoners from
their propriety, and all but scared the Second George beyond
seas.&nbsp; This terror in time subsided, but the interest in the
northern savages still survived, and was further stimulated when,
about fifteen years after, the portent of Macpherson&rsquo;s
Ossian burst on the astonished world of literature.&nbsp; Then
about eleven years later, in 1773, the burly and bigoted English
Lexicographer buttoned his great-coat up to the throat and set
out on a Highland <!-- page xxxiii--><a
name="pagexxxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiii</span>sheltie from Inverness, on that wonderful
&lsquo;Tour to the Hebrides,&rsquo; by which he determined to
extinguish for ever Macpherson and his impudent forgeries.&nbsp;
Such a tour seemed at that day as adventurous as would now be a
journey to the heart of Africa, and the stories which Johnson
told of the Hebrideans and their lives let in on his Cockney
readers the impression of a world as strange as any which
Livingstone could now report of.&nbsp; Then, in 1786, came Burns,
whose poetry, if it did not reach the ordinary Englishman of the
literary class, at least thrilled the hearts of English
poets.&nbsp; That Wordsworth had felt his power we know, for,
independent as he stood, and little wont to acknowledge his
indebtedness to any, he yet confesses in one place that it was
Burns who first set him on the right track.&nbsp; This series of
surprises coming from beyond the Tweed had drawn the eyes of
Englishmen towards Scotland.&nbsp; Especially two such
voices&mdash;Ossian speaking from the heart of the Highlands,
Burns concentrating in his song the whole strength and the
weakness also of Lowland character&mdash;seemed to call across
the Borders on Wordsworth to come and look on their land.&nbsp;
And during all the first days of that journey the thought of
Burns and his untimely end, then so recent, lay heavy on his
heart.</p>
<p>Again, it were well, as we read, to remember the time when
this Diary was written.&nbsp; It was before Scott was known as an
original poet, before he had given anything to the world save
&lsquo;The Border Minstrelsy.&rsquo;&nbsp; We are accustomed to
credit Scott with whatever enchantment invests Scotland in the
eyes of the English, and of foreigners.&nbsp; And doubtless a
large portion of it is due to him, but perhaps not quite so much
as we are apt to fancy.&nbsp; We <!-- page xxxiv--><a
name="pagexxxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiv</span>commonly suppose that it was he who first discovered
the Trossachs and Loch Katrine, and revealed them to the world in
&lsquo;The Lady of the Lake.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet they must have had
some earlier renown, enough to make Wordsworth, travelling two
years before the appearance even of Scott&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Lay,&rsquo; turn aside to go in search of them.</p>
<p>To Dorothy Wordsworth and Coleridge this was the first time
they had set foot on Scottish ground.&nbsp; Wordsworth himself
seems to have crossed the Border two years before this, though of
that journey there is no record remaining.&nbsp; As they set
forth from Keswick on that August morning one can well believe
that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Their exterior semblance did belie<br />
Their soul&rsquo;s immensity.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of the three paid much regard to the outward man.&nbsp;
Coleridge, perhaps, in soiled nankeen trousers, and with the blue
and brass in which he used to appear in Unitarian pulpits,
buttoned round his growing corpulency; Wordsworth in a suit of
russet, not to say dingy, brown, with a broad flapping straw hat
to protect his weak eyesight.&nbsp; And as for Miss Wordsworth,
we may well believe that in her dress she thought more of use
than of ornament.&nbsp; These three, mounted on their outlandish
Irish car, with a horse, now gibbing and backing over a bank, now
reduced to a walk, with one of the poets leading him by the head,
must have cut but a sorry figure, and wakened many a smile and
gibe in passers-by.&nbsp; As they wound their way up Nithsdale,
one can well imagine how some Border lord or laird, riding, or
driving past in smart equipage, would look on them askance,
taking them for what Burns calls a &lsquo;wheen gangrel
bodies,&rsquo; <!-- page xxxv--><a name="pagexxxv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxv</span>or for a set of Dominie Sampsons
from the other side the Border, or for some offshoot of the
&lsquo;Auld Licht&rsquo; Seceders.&nbsp; Poor Coleridge, ill at
ease, and in the dumps all the way, stretched asleep on the car
cushions, while the other two were admiring the scenery, could
not have added to their hilarity.&nbsp; And it must have been a
relief to Wordsworth and his sister, though the Journal hints it
not, when he left them at Loch Lomond.&nbsp; But however
grotesque their appearance may have been, they bore within them
that which made their journey rich in delight to themselves, not
to say to others.&nbsp; They were then both in their prime,
Wordsworth and his sister being just past thirty.&nbsp; They had
the observant eye and the feeling heart which money cannot
buy.&nbsp; No doubt to them, accustomed to the cleanness and
comfort of the farms and cottages of Westmoreland, those
&lsquo;homes of ancient peace,&rsquo; with their warm stone
porches and their shelter of household sycamores, the dirt and
discomfort of the inns and of the humbler abodes they entered
must have been repulsive enough.&nbsp; Even the gentlemen&rsquo;s
seats had to them an air of neglect and desolation, and the new
plantations of larch and fir with which they had then begun to be
surrounded, gave an impression of rawness, barrenness, and lack
of geniality.&nbsp; Nor less in large towns, as in Glasgow, were
they struck by the dulness and dreariness in the aspect and
demeanour of the dim &lsquo;common populations.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
saw and felt these things as keenly as any could do.&nbsp; But,
unlike ordinary travellers, they were not scared or disgusted by
them.&nbsp; They did not think that the first appearance was
all.&nbsp; They felt and saw that there was more behind.&nbsp;
With lively interest they note the healthy young women travelling
barefoot, though well <!-- page xxxvi--><a
name="pagexxxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxvi</span>dressed, the children without shoes or stockings, the
barefoot boys, some with their caps wreathed with wild-flowers,
others who could read Virgil or Homer.&nbsp; They pass, as
friends, beneath the humble cottage roofs, look with sympathy on
the countenances of the inmates, partake, when bidden, of their
homely fare, enter feelingly into their pathetic human
histories.&nbsp; They came there not to criticise, but to know
and feel.</p>
<p>Again, their intense love for their Westmoreland dales and
meres did not send them to look on those of Scotland with a sense
of rivalry, but of brotherhood.&nbsp; They were altogether free
from that vulgar habit of comparing scene with scene which so
poisons the eye to all true perception of natural
beauty,&mdash;as though the one great end were to graduate all
the various scenes of nature in the list of a competitive
examination.&nbsp; Hence whatever new they met with, they were
ready to welcome and enjoy.&nbsp; They could appreciate the long,
bare, houseless, treeless glens, not less than the well-wooded
lakes.&nbsp; And yet Miss Wordsworth&rsquo;s home-heartedness
makes her long for some touches of home and human habitation to
break the long bleak solitudes she passed through.&nbsp; The
absolute desolation of the Moor of Rannoch, so stirring to some,
was evidently too much for her.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The
loneliness<br />
Loaded her heart, the desert tired her eye.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, throughout the Journal we see how to her eye man and
nature interact on each other.&nbsp; That deep feeling, so strong
in her brother&rsquo;s poetry, of the interest that man gives to
nature, and still more the dignity that nature gives to man, is
not less strongly felt by her.&nbsp; It is man seen <!-- page
xxxvii--><a name="pagexxxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxvii</span>against a great background of nature and solitude
that most stirs her imagination.&nbsp; The woman sitting sole by
the margin of Daer Water, or the old man alone in the corn-field,
or the boy solitary on the Moor of Crawfordjohn&mdash;these in
her prose are pictures quite akin and equal to many a one that
occurs in her brother&rsquo;s verse.&nbsp; This sense of man with
&lsquo;grandeur circumfused,&rsquo; &lsquo;the sanctity of nature
given to man,&rsquo; is as primary in her as in her
brother.&nbsp; I cannot believe that she merely learnt it from
him.&nbsp; It must have been innate in both, derived by both from
one original source.</p>
<p>One is struck throughout by the absence of all effort at fine
or imaginative writing.&nbsp; But this only makes more effective
those natural gleams that come unbidden.&nbsp; After the dulness
of Glasgow and the Vale of Leven comes that wakening up to very
ecstasy among the islands of Loch Lomond,&mdash;that new world,
magical, enchanting.&nbsp; And then that plunge into the heart of
the Highlands, when they find themselves by the shores of Loch
Katrine, alone with the native people there,&mdash;the smell of
the peat-reek within, and the scent of the bog-myrtle without;
those &lsquo;gentle ardours&rsquo; that awake, as they move along
Lochawe-side and look into the cove of Cruachan, or catch that
Appin glen by Loch Linnhe, at the bright sunset hour, enlivened
by the haymaking people; or that new rapture they drink in at the
first glimpse, from Loch Etive shores, of the blue Atlantic
Isles.&nbsp; And then what a fitting close to such a tour was
that meeting with Walter Scott; the two great poets of their
time, both in the morning of their power, and both still unknown,
joining hands of friendship which was to last for life!</p>
<p>But I have said more than enough.&nbsp; Those who care <!--
page xxxviii--><a name="pagexxxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxviii</span>for the things which the Wordsworths cared for will
find in this quiet narrative much to their mind.&nbsp; And they
will find from it some new light shed on those delightful poems,
memorial of that tour, which remain as an undying track of glory
illuminating the path these two trod.&nbsp; These poems are
printed in the Appendix, that those who know them well may read
them once again, and that those who do not know them, except by
Guide-book extracts, may turn to them, after reading the Journal,
and try whether they cannot find in them something which they
never found elsewhere.</p>
<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is one entry, the last in the Journal, made as late as
1832, which alludes to a fact which, but for this note, might
have been left without comment. <a name="citation0c"></a><a
href="#footnote0c" class="citation">[0c]</a>&nbsp; Throughout the
whole tour no distinction seems to have been made between
Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; One would have thought that, if
nothing else, sympathy at least, which they did not lack, would
have led Wordsworth and his sister to turn aside and share the
Sabbath worship of the native people.&nbsp; Even the tired jade
might have put in his claim for his Sabbath rest; not to mention
the scandal which the sight of Sunday travellers in lonely parts
of Scotland must then have caused, and the name they must many a
<!-- page xxxix--><a name="pagexxxix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxix</span>time have earned for themselves,
of &lsquo;Sabbath-breakers.&rsquo;&nbsp; This last entry of 1832,
however, marks a change, which, if it came to Dorothy, came not
less decidedly to her brother.&nbsp; This change has been often
remarked on, and has been stigmatised by &lsquo;the enlightened
ones&rsquo; as &lsquo;the reaction.&rsquo;&nbsp; They say that
the earlier nature-worship, which they call Pantheistic, speaks
the true and genuine man; the later and more consciously
Christian mood they regard as the product, not of deepened
experience, but of timidity, or at least as the sign of
decreasing insight.&nbsp; It is not so that I would interpret
it.&nbsp; Wordsworth and his sister, with their rare gift of soul
and eye, saw further into nature, and felt it more profoundly
than common men can, and had no doubt found there something which
the gross world dreams not of.&nbsp; They recovered thence a
higher teaching, which men for ages had lost.&nbsp; They learnt
to think of God as being actually very near to them in all they
saw and heard; not as the mechanical Artificer, who makes a world
and then dwells aloof from it, but as</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Being that is in the clouds and air,<br
/>
That is in the green leaves among the groves.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In nature, which to most eyes is but a dull lifeless mass,
impelled by dead mechanic movements, their finer spirits were
aware of a breathing life, a living Presence, distinct, yet not
alien from, their own spirits, and thence they drank life, and
strength, and joy.&nbsp; And not in nature alone, but from their
own hearts, from the deep places of their moral nature, and from
their minglings with their fellow-men, they could oftentimes
overhear</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The still sad music of humanity,<br />
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power<br />
To chasten and subdue.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page xl--><a name="pagexl"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xl</span>And through this they learned to feel for themselves,
and not conventionally, the upholding presence of One on whom the
soul&rsquo;s &lsquo;dark foundations rest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Likely
enough, in the prime of their strength they may have imagined
that these teachings coming from nature and from man were in
themselves enough.</p>
<p>But when sorrow and bereavement came, and with them the
deepened sense of sin and of utter need, they learned that in
nature alone was nothing which in the end they could abide
by.&nbsp; They had been true to the lights they had, and they
were led on to higher.&nbsp; They were led to go beyond nature
and man for their ultimate support, and to overhear from that
higher region another, diviner &lsquo;tone, into which all the
strains of this world&rsquo;s music are ultimately to be
resolved.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Poet, nor less his sister, came at
length to feel, what philosophers find so hard to
believe,&mdash;that The Being whom he had long known as near him
in the solitudes of nature, as close to the beatings of his own
heart, was He who had so loved him as to die for him.&nbsp; True
it is that this later and more distinctly Christian experience is
but faintly reflected in Wordsworth&rsquo;s poetry compared with
the earlier naturalistic mood.&nbsp; But this is explained by the
fact that before the later experience became prominent, the early
fervour of poetic creation had already passed.&nbsp; Not the less
for this, however, was the poet&rsquo;s later conviction a riper,
more advanced wisdom&mdash;not a retrogression.</p>

1</span>FIRST WEEK.</h2>
<p>William and I parted from Mary on Sunday afternoon, August
14th, 1803; and William, Coleridge, and I left Keswick on Monday
morning, the 15th, at twenty minutes after eleven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The day was very hot; we walked up the
hills, and along all the rough road, which made our walking half
the day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; Travelled under the foot of
Carrock, a mountain covered with stones on the lower part; above,
it is very rocky, but sheep pasture there; we saw several where
there seemed to be no grass to tempt them.&nbsp; Passed the foot
of Grisdale and Mosedale, both pastoral valleys, narrow, and soon
terminating in the mountains&mdash;green, with scattered trees
and houses, and each a beautiful stream.&nbsp; At Grisdale our
horse backed upon a steep bank where the road was not fenced,
just above a pretty mill at the foot of the valley; and we had a
second threatening of a disaster in crossing a narrow bridge <!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>between the two dales; but this was not the fault of
either man or horse.&nbsp; Slept at Mr. Younghusband&rsquo;s
public-house, Hesket Newmarket.&nbsp; In the evening walked to
Caldbeck Falls, a delicious spot in which to breathe out a
summer&rsquo;s day&mdash;limestone rocks, hanging trees, pools,
and waterbreaks&mdash;caves and caldrons which have been honoured
with fairy names, and no doubt continue in the fancy of the
neighbourhood to resound with fairy revels.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>August</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Passed Rose
Castle upon the Caldew, an ancient building of red stone with
sloping gardens, an ivied gateway, velvet lawns, old garden
walls, trim flower-borders with stately and luxuriant
flowers.&nbsp; We walked up to the house and stood some minutes
watching the swallows that flew about restlessly, and flung their
shadows upon the sunbright walls of the old building; the shadows
glanced and twinkled, interchanged and crossed each other,
expanded and shrunk up, appeared and disappeared every instant;
as I observed to William and Coleridge, seeming more like living
things than the birds themselves.&nbsp; Dined at Carlisle; the
town in a bustle with the assizes; so many strange faces known in
former times and recognised, that it half seemed as if I ought to
know them all, and, together with the noise, the fine ladies,
etc., they put me into confusion.&nbsp; This day Hatfield was
condemned <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp; I stood at the door of the
gaoler&rsquo;s house, where he was; William entered the house,
and Coleridge saw him; I fell into conversation with a debtor,
who told me in a dry way that he was &lsquo;far
over-learned,&rsquo; and another man observed to William that we
might learn from Hatfield&rsquo;s fate &lsquo;not to meddle with
pen and ink.&rsquo;&nbsp; We gave a shilling to my companion,
whom we found out to be <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>a friend of the family, a
fellow-sailor with my brother John <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a> &lsquo;in Captain
Wordsworth&rsquo;s ship.&rsquo;&nbsp; Walked upon the city walls,
which are broken down in places and crumbling away, and most
disgusting from filth.&nbsp; The city and neighbourhood of
Carlisle disappointed me; the banks of the river quite flat, and,
though the holms are rich, there is not much beauty in the vale
from the want of trees&mdash;at least to the eye of a person
coming from England, and, I scarcely know how, but to me the
holms had not a natural look; there was something townish in
their appearance, a dulness in their strong deep green.&nbsp; To
Longtown&mdash;not very interesting, except from the long views
over the flat country; the road rough, chiefly newly
mended.&nbsp; Reached Longtown after sunset, a town of brick
houses belonging chiefly to the Graham family.&nbsp; Being in the
form of a cross and not long, it had been better called
Crosstown.&nbsp; There are several shops, and it is not a very
small place; but I could not meet with a silver thimble, and
bought a halfpenny brass one.&nbsp; Slept at the Graham&rsquo;s
Arms, a large inn.&nbsp; Here, as everywhere else, the people
seemed utterly insensible of the enormity of Hatfield&rsquo;s
offences; the ostler told William that he was quite a gentleman,
paid every one genteelly, etc. etc.&nbsp; He and
&lsquo;Mary&rsquo; had walked together to Gretna Green; a heavy
rain came on when they were there; a returned chaise happened to
pass, and the driver would have taken them up; but &lsquo;Mr.
Hope&rsquo;s&rsquo; carriage was to be sent for; he did not
choose to accept the chaise-driver&rsquo;s offer.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>August</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left
Longtown after breakfast.&nbsp; About half-a-mile from the town a
guide-post and two roads, to Edinburgh and Glasgow; we took the
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>left-hand road, to Glasgow.&nbsp; Here saw a specimen of
the luxuriance of the heath-plant, as it grows in Scotland; it
was in the enclosed plantations&mdash;perhaps sheltered by
them.&nbsp; These plantations appeared to be not well grown for
their age; the trees were stunted.&nbsp; Afterwards the road,
treeless, over a peat-moss common&mdash;the Solway Moss; here and
there an earth-built hut with its peat stack, a scanty growing
willow hedge round the kailgarth, perhaps the cow pasturing
near,&mdash;a little lass watching it,&mdash;the dreary waste
cheered by the endless singing of larks.</p>
<p>We enter Scotland by crossing the river Sark; on the Scotch
side of the bridge the ground is unenclosed pasturage; it was
very green, and scattered over with that yellow flowered plant
which we call grunsel; the hills heave and swell prettily enough;
cattle feeding; a few corn fields near the river.&nbsp; At the
top of the hill opposite is Springfield, a village built by Sir
William Maxwell&mdash;a dull uniformity in the houses, as is
usual when all built at one time, or belonging to one individual,
each just big enough for two people to live in, and in which a
family, large or small as it may happen, is crammed.&nbsp; There
the marriages are performed.&nbsp; Further on, though almost
contiguous, is Gretna Green, upon a hill and among trees.&nbsp;
This sounds well, but it is a dreary place; the stone houses
dirty and miserable, with broken windows.&nbsp; There is a
pleasant view from the churchyard over Solway Firth to the
Cumberland mountains.&nbsp; Dined at Annan.&nbsp; On our left as
we travelled along appeared the Solway Firth and the mountains
beyond, but the near country dreary.&nbsp; Those houses by the
roadside which are built of stone are comfortless and dirty; but
we peeped into a clay &lsquo;biggin&rsquo; that was very
&lsquo;canny,&rsquo; and <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>I daresay will be as warm as a
swallow&rsquo;s nest in winter.&nbsp; The town of Annan made me
think of France and Germany; many of the houses large and gloomy,
the size of them outrunning the comforts.&nbsp; One thing which
was like Germany pleased me: the shopkeepers express their
calling by some device or painting; bread-bakers have biscuits,
loaves, cakes painted on their window-shutters; blacksmiths
horses&rsquo; shoes, iron tools, etc. etc.; and so on through all
trades.</p>
<p>Reached Dumfries at about nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;market-day;
met crowds of people on the road, and every one had a smile for
us and our car . . . .&nbsp; The inn was a large house, and
tolerably comfortable; Mr. Rogers and his sister, whom we had
seen at our own cottage at Grasmere a few days before, had
arrived there that same afternoon on their way to the Highlands;
but we did not see them till the next morning, and only for about
a quarter of an hour.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>August</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went to the
churchyard where Burns is buried.&nbsp; A bookseller accompanied
us.&nbsp; He showed us the outside of Burns&rsquo;s house, where
he had lived the last three years of his life, and where he
died.&nbsp; It has a mean appearance, and is in a bye situation,
whitewashed; dirty about the doors, as almost all Scotch houses
are; flowering plants in the windows.</p>
<p>Went on to visit his grave.&nbsp; He lies at a corner of the
churchyard, and his second son, Francis Wallace, beside
him.&nbsp; There is no stone to mark the spot; <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> but a hundred guineas have been
collected, to be expended on some sort of monument.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There,&rsquo; said the bookseller, pointing to a pompous
monument, &lsquo;there lies Mr. Such-a-one&rsquo;&mdash;I have
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>forgotten his name,&mdash;&lsquo;a remarkably clever man;
he was an attorney, and hardly ever lost a cause he
undertook.&nbsp; Burns made many a lampoon upon him, and there
they rest, as you see.&rsquo;&nbsp; We looked at the grave with
melancholy and painful reflections, repeating to each other his
own verses:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Is there a man whose judgment clear<br
/>
Can others teach the course to steer,<br />
Yet runs himself life&rsquo;s mad career<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild as the
wave?&mdash;<br />
Here let him pause, and through a tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survey this
grave.<br />
The Poor Inhabitant below<br />
Was quick to learn, and wise to know,<br />
And keenly felt the friendly glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And softer
flame;<br />
But thoughtless follies laid him low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And
stain&rsquo;d his name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The churchyard is full of grave-stones and expensive monuments
in all sorts of fantastic shapes&mdash;obelisk-wise, pillar-wise,
etc.&nbsp; In speaking of Gretna Green, I forgot to mention that
we visited the churchyard.&nbsp; The church is like a huge house;
indeed, so are all the churches, with a steeple, not a square
tower or spire,&mdash;a sort of thing more like a glass-house
chimney than a Church of England steeple; grave-stones in
abundance, few verses, yet there were some&mdash;no texts.&nbsp;
Over the graves of married women the maiden name instead of that
of the husband, &lsquo;spouse&rsquo; instead of
&lsquo;wife,&rsquo; and the place of abode preceded by
&lsquo;in&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;of.&rsquo;&nbsp; When our
guide had left us, we turned again to Burns&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;
Mrs. Burns was gone to spend some time by the sea-shore with her
children.&nbsp; We spoke to the servant-maid at the door, who
invited us forward, and we sate down in the parlour.&nbsp; The
walls were <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>coloured with a blue wash; on one side
of the fire was a mahogany desk, opposite to the window a clock,
and over the desk a print from the &lsquo;Cotter&rsquo;s Saturday
Night,&rsquo; which Burns mentions in one of his letters having
received as a present.&nbsp; The house was cleanly and neat in
the inside, the stairs of stone, scoured white, the kitchen on
the right side of the passage, the parlour on the left.&nbsp; In
the room above the parlour the Poet died, and his son after him
in the same room.&nbsp; The servant told us she had lived five
years with Mrs. Burns, who was now in great sorrow for the death
of &lsquo;Wallace.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said that Mrs. Burns&rsquo;s
youngest son was at Christ&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>We were glad to leave Dumfries, which is no agreeable place to
them who do not love the bustle of a town that seems to be rising
up to wealth.&nbsp; We could think of little else but poor Burns,
and his moving about on that unpoetic ground.&nbsp; In our road
to Brownhill, the next stage, we passed Ellisland at a little
distance on our right, his farmhouse.&nbsp; We might there have
had more pleasure in looking round, if we had been nearer to the
spot; but there is no thought surviving in connexion with
Burns&rsquo;s daily life that is not heart-depressing.&nbsp;
Travelled through the vale of Nith, here little like a vale, it
is so broad, with irregular hills rising up on each side, in
outline resembling the old-fashioned valances of a bed.&nbsp;
There is a great deal of arable land; the corn ripe; trees here
and there&mdash;plantations, clumps, coppices, and a newness in
everything.&nbsp; So much of the gorse and broom rooted out that
you wonder why it is not all gone, and yet there seems to be
almost as much gorse and broom as corn; and they grow one among
another you know not how.&nbsp; Crossed the Nith; the vale
becomes narrow, and very pleasant; <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>cornfields,
green hills, clay cottages; the river&rsquo;s bed rocky, with
woody banks.&nbsp; Left the Nith about a mile and a half, and
reached Brownhill, a lonely inn, where we slept.&nbsp; The view
from the windows was pleasing, though some travellers might have
been disposed to quarrel with it for its general nakedness; yet
there was abundance of corn.&nbsp; It is an open
country&mdash;open, yet all over hills.&nbsp; At a little
distance were many cottages among trees, that looked very
pretty.&nbsp; Brownhill is about seven or eight miles from
Ellisland.&nbsp; I fancied to myself, while I was sitting in the
parlour, that Burns might have caroused there, for most likely
his rounds extended so far, and this thought gave a melancholy
interest to the smoky walls.&nbsp; It was as pretty a room as a
thoroughly dirty one could be&mdash;a square parlour painted
green, but so covered over with smoke and dirt that it looked not
unlike green seen through black gauze.&nbsp; There were three
windows, looking three ways, a buffet ornamented with tea-cups, a
superfine largeish looking-glass with gilt ornaments spreading
far and wide, the glass spotted with dirt, some ordinary alehouse
pictures, and above the chimney-piece a print in a much better
style&mdash;as William guessed, taken from a painting by Sir
Joshua Reynolds&mdash;of some lady of quality, in the character
of Euphrosyne.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said the servant girl,
seeing that we looked at it, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s many travellers
would give a deal for that, it&rsquo;s more admired than any in
the house.&rsquo;&nbsp; We could not but smile; for the rest were
such as may be found in the basket of any Italian image and
picture hawker.</p>
<p>William and I walked out after dinner; Coleridge was not well,
and slept upon the carriage cushions.&nbsp; We made our way to
the cottages among the little hills and knots of wood, and then
saw what a delightful country <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>this part of
Scotland might be made by planting forest trees.&nbsp; The ground
all over heaves and swells like a sea; but for miles there are
neither trees nor hedgerows, only &lsquo;mound&rsquo; fences and
tracts; or slips of corn, potatoes, clover&mdash;with hay
between, and barren land; but near the cottages many hills and
hillocks covered with wood.&nbsp; We passed some fine trees, and
paused under the shade of one close by an old mansion that seemed
from its neglected state to be inhabited by farmers.&nbsp; But I
must say that many of the &lsquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s&rsquo; houses
which we have passed in Scotland have an air of neglect, and even
of desolation.&nbsp; It was a beech, in the full glory of
complete and perfect growth, very tall, with one thick stem
mounting to a considerable height, which was split into four
&lsquo;thighs,&rsquo; as Coleridge afterwards called them, each
in size a fine tree.&nbsp; Passed another mansion, now tenanted
by a schoolmaster; many boys playing upon the lawn.&nbsp; I
cannot take leave of the country which we passed through to-day,
without mentioning that we saw the Cumberland mountains within
half a mile of Ellisland, Burns&rsquo;s house, the last view we
had of them.&nbsp; Drayton has prettily described the connexion
which this neighbourhood has with ours when he makes Skiddaw
say&mdash;</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Scurfell
<a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"

That Anadale <a name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a> doth crown, with a most amorous eye,<br
/>
Salutes me every day, or at my pride looks grim,<br />
Oft threatning me with clouds, as I oft threatning
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These lines recurred to William&rsquo;s memory, and we talked
of Burns, and of the prospect he must have had, perhaps from his
own door, of Skiddaw and his companions, indulging ourselves in
the fancy that we might have been <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>personally
known to each other, and he have looked upon those objects with
more pleasure for our sakes.&nbsp; We talked of Coleridge&rsquo;s
children and family, then at the foot of Skiddaw, and our own
new-born John a few miles behind it; while the grave of
Burns&rsquo;s son, which we had just seen by the side of his
father, and some stories heard at Dumfries respecting the dangers
his surviving children were exposed to, filled us with melancholy
concern, which had a kind of connexion with ourselves.&nbsp; In
recollection of this, William long afterwards wrote the following
Address to the sons of the ill-fated poet:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Ye now are panting up life&rsquo;s hill,<br />
&rsquo;Tis twilight time of good and ill,<br />
And more than common strength and skill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must ye
display,<br />
If ye would give the better will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its lawful
sway.</p>
<p class="poetry">Strong-bodied if ye be to bear<br />
Intemperance with less harm, beware,<br />
But if your Father&rsquo;s wit ye share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, then
indeed,<br />
Ye Sons of Burns, for watchful care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be
need.</p>
<p class="poetry">For honest men delight will take<br />
To shew you favour for his sake,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your steps
pursue,<br />
And of your Father&rsquo;s name will make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snare for
you.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>August</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Open country
for a considerable way.&nbsp; Passed through the village of
Thornhill, built by the Duke of Queensberry; the
&lsquo;brother-houses&rsquo; so small that they might have been
built to stamp a character of insolent pride on his own huge
mansion of Drumlanrigg, which is full in view on the opposite
side of the Nith.&nbsp; This mansion is indeed very large; but to
us it appeared like a gathering together of little things.&nbsp;
The roof is broken into a hundred pieces, cupolas, etc., in the
shape of casters, conjuror&rsquo;s balls, cups, and the
like.&nbsp; The situation would be noble if the woods had been
left standing; but they have been cut down not long ago, and the
hills above and below the house are quite bare.&nbsp; About a
mile and a half from Drumlanrigg is a turnpike gate at the top of
a hill.&nbsp; We left our car with the man, and turned aside into
a field where we looked down upon the Nith, which runs far below
in a deep and rocky channel; the banks woody; the view pleasant
down the river towards Thornhill, an open country&mdash;corn
fields, pastures, and scattered trees.&nbsp; Returned to the
turnpike house, a cold spot upon a common, black cattle feeding
close to the door.&nbsp; Our road led us down the hill to the
side of the Nith, and we travelled along its banks for some
miles.&nbsp; Here were clay cottages perhaps every half or
quarter of a mile.&nbsp; The bed of the stream rough with rocks;
banks irregular, now woody, now bare; <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>here a patch
of broom, there of corn, then of pasturage; and hills green or
heathy above.&nbsp; We were to have given our horse meal and
water at a public-house in one of the hamlets we passed through,
but missed the house, for, as is common in Scotland, it was
without a sign-board.&nbsp; Travelled on, still beside the Nith,
till we came to a turnpike house, which stood rather high on the
hill-side, and from the door we looked a long way up and down the
river.&nbsp; The air coldish, the wind strong.</p>
<p>We asked the turnpike man to let us have some meal and
water.&nbsp; He had no meal, but luckily we had part of a feed of
corn brought from Keswick, and he procured some hay at a
neighbouring house.&nbsp; In the meantime I went into the house,
where was an old man with a grey plaid over his shoulders,
reading a newspaper.&nbsp; On the shelf lay a volume of the
Scotch Encyclop&aelig;dia, a History of England, and some other
books.&nbsp; The old man was a caller by the way.&nbsp; The man
of the house came back, and we began to talk.&nbsp; He was very
intelligent; had travelled all over England, Scotland, and
Ireland as a gentleman&rsquo;s servant, and now lived alone in
that lonesome place.&nbsp; He said he was tired of his bargain,
for he feared he should lose by it.&nbsp; And he had indeed a
troublesome office, for coal-carts without number were passing
by, and the drivers seemed to do their utmost to cheat him.&nbsp;
There is always something peculiar in the house of a man living
alone.&nbsp; This was but half-furnished, yet nothing seemed
wanting for his comfort, though a female who had travelled half
as far would have needed fifty other things.&nbsp; He had no
other meat or drink in the house but oat bread and
cheese&mdash;the cheese was made with the addition of
seeds&mdash;and some skimmed milk.&nbsp; He gave us of his bread
and cheese, and milk, which proved to be sour.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>We had yet ten or eleven miles to travel, and no food
with us.&nbsp; William lay under the wind in a corn-field below
the house, being not well enough to partake of the milk and
bread.&nbsp; Coleridge gave our host a pamphlet, &lsquo;The
Crisis of the Sugar Colonies;&rsquo; he was well acquainted with
Burns&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; There was a politeness and a manly
freedom in this man&rsquo;s manners which pleased me very
much.&nbsp; He told us that he had served a gentleman, a captain
in the army&mdash;he did not know who he was, for none of his
relations had ever come to see him, but he used to receive many
letters&mdash;that he had lived near Dumfries till they would let
him stay no longer, he made such havoc with the game; his whole
delight from morning till night, and the long year through, was
in field sports; he would be on his feet the worst days in
winter, and wade through snow up to the middle after his
game.&nbsp; If he had company he was in tortures till they were
gone; he would then throw off his coat and put on an old jacket
not worth half-a-crown.&nbsp; He drank his bottle of wine every
day, and two if he had better sport than usual.&nbsp; Ladies
sometimes came to stay with his wife, and he often carried them
out in an Irish jaunting-car, and if they vexed him he would
choose the dirtiest roads possible, and spoil their clothes by
jumping in and out of the car, and treading upon them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But for all that&rsquo;&mdash;and so he ended
all&mdash;&lsquo;he was a good fellow, and a clever fellow, and
he liked him well.&rsquo;&nbsp; He would have ten or a dozen
hares in the larder at once, he half maintained his family with
game, and he himself was very fond of eating of the
spoil&mdash;unusual with true heart-and-soul sportsmen.</p>
<p>The man gave us an account of his farm where he had lived,
which was so cheap and pleasant that we thought <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>we should
have liked to have had it ourselves.&nbsp; Soon after leaving the
turnpike house we turned up a hill to the right, the road for a
little way very steep, bare hills, with sheep.</p>
<p>After ascending a little while we heard the murmur of a stream
far below us, and saw it flowing downwards on our left, towards
the Nith, and before us, between steep green hills, coming along
a winding valley.&nbsp; The simplicity of the prospect impressed
us very much.&nbsp; There was a single cottage by the brook side;
the dell was not heathy, but it was impossible not to think of
Peter Bell&rsquo;s Highland Girl.</p>
<p>We now felt indeed that we were in Scotland; there was a
natural peculiarity in this place.&nbsp; In the scenes of the
Nith it had not been the same as England, but yet not simple,
naked Scotland.&nbsp; The road led us down the hill, and now
there was no room in the vale but for the river and the road; we
had sometimes the stream to the right, sometimes to the
left.&nbsp; The hills were pastoral, but we did not see many
sheep; green smooth turf on the left, no ferns.&nbsp; On the
right the heath-plant grew in abundance, of the most exquisite
colour; it covered a whole hillside, or it was in streams and
patches.&nbsp; We travelled along the vale without appearing to
ascend for some miles; all the reaches were beautiful, in
exquisite proportion, the hills seeming very high from being so
near to us.&nbsp; It might have seemed a valley which nature had
kept to herself for pensive thoughts and tender feelings, but
that we were reminded at every turning of the road of something
beyond by the coal-carts which were travelling towards us.&nbsp;
Though these carts broke in upon the tranquillity of the glen,
they added much to the picturesque effect of the different views,
which <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>indeed wanted nothing, though
perfectly bare, houseless, and treeless.</p>
<p>After some time our road took us upwards towards the end of
the valley.&nbsp; Now the steeps were heathy all around.&nbsp;
Just as we began to climb the hill we saw three boys who came
down the cleft of a brow on our left; one carried a fishing-rod,
and the hats of all were braided with honeysuckles; they ran
after one another as wanton as the wind.&nbsp; I cannot express
what a character of beauty those few honeysuckles in the hats of
the three boys gave to the place: what bower could they have come
from?&nbsp; We walked up the hill, met two well-dressed
travellers, the woman barefoot.&nbsp; Our little lads before they
had gone far were joined by some half-dozen of their companions,
all without shoes and stockings.&nbsp; They told us they lived at
Wanlockhead, the village above, pointing to the top of the hill;
they went to school and learned Latin, Virgil, and some of them
Greek, Homer, but when Coleridge began to inquire further, off
they ran, poor things! I suppose afraid of being examined.</p>
<p>When, after a steep ascent, we had reached the top of the
hill, we saw a village about half a mile before us on the side of
another hill, which rose up above the spot where we were, after a
descent, a sort of valley or hollow.&nbsp; Nothing grew upon this
ground, or the hills above or below, but heather, yet round about
the village&mdash;which consisted of a great number of huts, all
alike, and all thatched, with a few larger slated houses among
them, and a single modern-built one of a considerable
size&mdash;were a hundred patches of cultivated ground, potatoes,
oats, hay, and grass.&nbsp; We were struck with the sight of
haycocks fastened down with aprons, sheets, <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>pieces of
sacking&mdash;as we supposed, to prevent the wind from blowing
them away.&nbsp; We afterwards found that this practice was very
general in Scotland.&nbsp; Every cottage seemed to have its
little plot of ground, fenced by a ridge of earth; this plot
contained two or three different divisions, kail, potatoes, oats,
hay; the houses all standing in lines, or never far apart; the
cultivated ground was all together also, and made a very strange
appearance with its many greens among the dark brown hills,
neither tree nor shrub growing; yet the grass and the potatoes
looked greener than elsewhere, owing to the bareness of the
neighbouring hills; it was indeed a wild and singular
spot&mdash;to use a woman&rsquo;s illustration, like a collection
of patchwork, made of pieces as they might have chanced to have
been cut by the mantua-maker, only just smoothed to fit each
other, the different sorts of produce being in such a multitude
of plots, and those so small and of such irregular shapes.&nbsp;
Add to the strangeness of the village itself, that we had been
climbing upwards, though gently, for many miles, and for the last
mile and a half up a steep ascent, and did not know of any
village till we saw the boys who had come out to play.&nbsp; The
air was very cold, and one could not help thinking what it must
be in winter, when those hills, now &lsquo;red brown,&rsquo;
should have their three months&rsquo; covering of snow.</p>
<p>The village, as we guessed, is inhabited by miners; the mines
belong to the Duke of Queensberry.&nbsp; The road to the village,
down which the lads scampered away, was straight forward.&nbsp; I
must mention that we met, just after we had parted from them,
another little fellow, about six years old, carrying a bundle
over his shoulder; he seemed poor and half starved, and was
scratching his fingers, which were <!-- page 17--><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>covered with
the itch.&nbsp; He was a miner&rsquo;s son, and lived at
Wanlockhead; did not go to school, but this was probably on
account of his youth.&nbsp; I mention him because he seemed to be
a proof that there was poverty and wretchedness among these
people, though we saw no other symptom of it; and afterwards we
met scores of the inhabitants of this same village.&nbsp; Our
road turned to the right, and we saw, at the distance of less
than a mile, a tall upright building of grey stone, with several
men standing upon the roof, as if they were looking out over
battlements.&nbsp; It stood beyond the village, upon higher
ground, as if presiding over it,&mdash;a kind of
enchanter&rsquo;s castle, which it might have been, a place where
Don Quixote would have gloried in.&nbsp; When we drew nearer we
saw, coming out of the side of the building, a large machine or
lever, in appearance like a great forge-hammer, as we supposed
for raising water out of the mines.&nbsp; It heaved upwards once
in half a minute with a slow motion, and seemed to rest to take
breath at the bottom, its motion being accompanied with a sound
between a groan and &lsquo;jike.&rsquo;&nbsp; There would have
been something in this object very striking in any place, as it
was impossible not to invest the machine with some faculty of
intellect; it seemed to have made the first step from brute
matter to life and purpose, showing its progress by great
power.&nbsp; William made a remark to this effect, and Coleridge
observed that it was like a giant with one idea.&nbsp; At all
events, the object produced a striking effect in that place,
where everything was in unison with it&mdash;particularly the
building itself, which was turret-shaped, and with the figures
upon it resembled much one of the fortresses in the wooden cuts
of Bunyan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Holy War.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After ascending a considerable way we began to descend <!--
page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>again; and now we met a team of horses dragging an
immense tree to the lead mines, to repair or add to the building,
and presently after we came to a cart, with another large tree,
and one horse left in it, right in the middle of the
highway.&nbsp; We were a little out of humour, thinking we must
wait till the team came back.&nbsp; There were men and boys
without number all staring at us; after a little consultation
they set their shoulders to the cart, and with a good heave all
at once they moved it, and we passed along.&nbsp; These people
were decently dressed, and their manners decent; there was no
hooting or impudent laughter.&nbsp; Leadhills, another mining
village, was the place of our destination for the night; and soon
after we had passed the cart we came in sight of it.&nbsp; This
village and the mines belong to Lord Hopetoun; it has more stone
houses than Wanlockhead, one large old mansion, and a
considerable number of old trees&mdash;beeches, I believe.&nbsp;
The trees told of the coldness of the climate; they were more
brown than green&mdash;far browner than the ripe grass of the
little hay-garths.&nbsp; Here, as at Wanlockhead, were haycocks,
hay-stacks, potato-beds, and kail-garths in every possible
variety of shape, but, I suppose from the irregularity of the
ground, it looked far less artificial&mdash;indeed, I should
think that a painter might make several beautiful pictures in
this village.&nbsp; It straggles down both sides of a mountain
glen.&nbsp; As I have said, there is a large mansion.&nbsp; There
is also a stone building that looks like a school, and the houses
are single, or in clusters, or rows as it may chance.</p>
<p>We passed a decent-looking inn, the Hopetoun Arms; but the
house of Mrs. Otto, a widow, had been recommended to us with high
encomiums.&nbsp; We did not then <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>understand
Scotch inns, and were not quite satisfied at first with our
accommodations, but all things were smoothed over by degrees; we
had a fire lighted in our dirty parlour, tea came after a
reasonable waiting; and the fire with the gentle aid of twilight,
burnished up the room into cheerful comfort.&nbsp; Coleridge was
weary; but William and I walked out after tea.&nbsp; We talked
with one of the miners, who informed us that the building which
we had supposed to be a school was a library belonging to the
village.&nbsp; He said they had got a book into it a few weeks
ago, which had cost thirty pounds, and that they had all sorts of
books.&nbsp; &lsquo;What! have you Shakespeare?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, we have that,&rsquo; and we found, on further
inquiry, that they had a large library, <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a> of long standing, that Lord Hopetoun
had subscribed liberally to it, and that gentlemen who came with
him were in the habit of making larger or smaller
donations.&nbsp; Each man who had the benefit of it paid a small
sum monthly&mdash;I think about fourpence.</p>
<p>The man we talked with spoke much of the comfort and quiet in
which they lived one among another; he made use of a noticeable
expression, saying that they were &lsquo;very peaceable people
considering they lived so much underground;&rsquo;&mdash;wages
were about thirty pounds a year; they had land for potatoes, warm
houses, plenty of coals, and only six hours&rsquo; work each day,
so that they had leisure for reading if they chose.&nbsp; He said
the place was healthy, that the inhabitants lived to a great age;
and indeed we saw no appearance of ill-health in their
countenances; but it is not common for people working in lead
mines to be healthy; and I have since heard that it is <i>not</i>
a healthy place.&nbsp; However this may be, they are unwilling to
allow it; for the landlady the next morning, when I said to her
&lsquo;You have <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>a cold climate,&rsquo; replied,
&lsquo;Ay, but it is <i>varra halesome</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; We
inquired of the man respecting the large mansion; he told us that
it was built, as we might see, in the form of an H, and belonged
to the Hopetouns, and they took their title from thence, <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a> and that part of it was used as a
chapel.&nbsp; We went close to it, and were a good deal amused
with the building itself, standing forth in bold contradiction of
the story which I daresay every man of Leadhills tells, and every
man believes, that it is in the shape of an H; it is but half an
H, and one must be very accommodating to allow it even so much,
for the legs are far too short.</p>
<p>We visited the burying-ground, a plot of land not very small,
crowded with graves, and upright grave-stones, overlooking the
village and the dell.&nbsp; It was now the closing in of
evening.&nbsp; Women and children were gathering in the linen for
the night, which was bleaching by the burn-side;&mdash;the graves
overgrown with grass, such as, by industrious culture, had been
raised up about the houses; but there were bunches of heather
here and there, and with the blue-bells that grew among the grass
the small plot of ground had a beautiful and wild appearance.</p>
<p>William left me, and I went to a shop to purchase some thread;
the woman had none that suited me; but she would send a
&lsquo;<i>wee</i> lad&rsquo; to the other shop.&nbsp; In the
meantime I sat with the mother, and was much pleased with her
manner and conversation.&nbsp; She had an excellent fire, and her
cottage, though very small, looked comfortable and cleanly; but
remember I saw it only by firelight.&nbsp; She confirmed what the
man had told us of the quiet manner in which they lived; and
indeed her house and fireside seemed to need <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>nothing to
make it a cheerful happy spot, but health and good humour.&nbsp;
There was a bookishness, a certain formality in this
woman&rsquo;s language, which was very remarkable.&nbsp; She had
a dark complexion, dark eyes, and wore a very white cap, much
over her face, which gave her the look of a French woman, and
indeed afterwards the women on the roads frequently reminded us
of French women, partly from the extremely white caps of the
elder women, and still more perhaps from a certain gaiety and
party-coloured appearance in their dress in general.&nbsp; White
bed-gowns are very common, and you rarely meet a young girl with
either hat or cap; they buckle up their hair often in a graceful
manner.</p>
<p>I returned to the inn, and went into the kitchen to speak with
the landlady; she had made a hundred hesitations when I told her
we wanted three beds.&nbsp; At last she confessed she <i>had</i>
three beds, and showed me into a parlour which looked damp and
cold, but she assured me in a tone that showed she was unwilling
to be questioned further, that all <i>her</i> beds were well
aired.&nbsp; I sat a while by the kitchen fire with the landlady,
and began to talk to her; but, much as I had heard in her
praise&mdash;for the shopkeeper had told me she was a varra
discreet woman&mdash;I cannot say that her manners pleased me
much.&nbsp; But her servant made amends, for she was as pleasant
and cheerful a lass as was ever seen; and when we asked her to do
anything, she answered, &lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; with a merry smile,
and almost ran to get us what we wanted.&nbsp; She was about
sixteen years old: wore shoes and stockings, and had her hair
tucked up with a comb.&nbsp; The servant at Brownhill was a
coarse-looking wench, barefoot and barelegged.&nbsp; I examined
the kitchen round about; it was <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>crowded with
furniture, drawers, cupboards, dish-covers, pictures, pans, and
pots, arranged without order, except that the plates were on
shelves, and the dish-covers hung in rows; these were very clean,
but floors, passages, staircase, everything else dirty.&nbsp;
There were two beds in recesses in the wall; above one of them I
noticed a shelf with some books:&mdash;it made me think of
Chaucer&rsquo;s Clerke of Oxenforde:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Liever had he at his bed&rsquo;s head<br
/>
Twenty books clothed in black and red.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were baking oat-bread, which they cut into quarters, and
half-baked over the fire, and half-toasted before it.&nbsp; There
was a suspiciousness about Mrs. Otto, almost like ill-nature; she
was very jealous of any inquiries that might appear to be made
with the faintest idea of a comparison between Leadhills and any
other place, except the advantage was evidently on the side of
Leadhills.&nbsp; We had nice honey to breakfast.&nbsp; When ready
to depart, we learned that we might have seen the library, which
we had not thought of till it was too late, and we were very
sorry to go away without seeing it.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>August</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left
Leadhills at nine o&rsquo;clock, regretting much that we could
not stay another day, that we might have made more minute
inquiries respecting the manner of living of the miners, and been
able to form an estimate, from our own observation, of the degree
of knowledge, health, and comfort that there was among
them.&nbsp; The air was keen and cold; we might have supposed it
to be three months later in the season and two hours earlier in
the day.&nbsp; The landlady had not lighted us a fire; so <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>I was obliged to get myself toasted in the kitchen, and
when we set off I put on both grey cloak and spencer.</p>
<p>Our road carried us down the valley, and we soon lost sight of
Leadhills, for the valley made a turn almost immediately, and we
saw two miles, perhaps, before us; the glen sloped somewhat
rapidly&mdash;heathy, bare, no hut or house.&nbsp; Passed by a
shepherd, who was sitting upon the ground, reading, with the book
on his knee, screened from the wind by his plaid, while a flock
of sheep were feeding near him among the rushes and coarse
grass&mdash;for, as we descended we came among lands where grass
grew with the heather.&nbsp; Travelled through several reaches of
the glen, which somewhat resembled the valley of Menock on the
other side of Wanlockhead; but it was not near so beautiful; the
forms of the mountains did not melt so exquisitely into each
other, and there was a coldness, and, if I may so speak, a want
of simplicity in the surface of the earth; the heather was poor,
not covering a whole hillside; not in luxuriant streams and beds
interveined with rich verdure; but patchy and stunted, with here
and there coarse grass and rushes.&nbsp; But we soon came in
sight of a spot that impressed us very much.&nbsp; At the lower
end of this new reach of the vale was a decayed tree, beside a
decayed cottage, the vale spreading out into a level area which
was one large field, without fence and without division, of a
dull yellow colour; the vale seemed to partake of the desolation
of the cottage, and to participate in its decay.&nbsp; And yet
the spot was in its nature so dreary that one would rather have
wondered how it ever came to be tenanted by man, than lament that
it was left to waste and solitude.&nbsp; Yet the encircling hills
were so exquisitely formed that it was impossible to conceive
anything more <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>lovely than this place would have
been if the valley and hill-sides had been interspersed with
trees, cottages, green fields, and hedgerows.&nbsp; But all was
desolate; the one large field which filled up the area of the
valley appeared, as I have said, in decay, and seemed to retain
the memory of its connexion with man in some way analogous to the
ruined building; for it was as much of a field as Mr.
King&rsquo;s best pasture scattered over with his fattest
cattle.</p>
<p>We went on, looking before us, the place losing nothing of its
hold upon our minds, when we discovered a woman sitting right in
the middle of the field, alone, wrapped up in a grey cloak or
plaid.&nbsp; She sat motionless all the time we looked at her,
which might be nearly half an hour.&nbsp; We could not conceive
why she sat there, for there were neither sheep nor cattle in the
field; her appearance was very melancholy.&nbsp; In the meantime
our road carried us nearer to the cottage, though we were
crossing over the hill to the left, leaving the valley below us,
and we perceived that a part of the building was inhabited, and
that what we had supposed to be <i>one</i> blasted tree was eight
trees, four of which were entirely blasted; the others partly so,
and round about the place was a little potato and cabbage garth,
fenced with earth.&nbsp; No doubt, that woman had been an
inhabitant of the cottage.&nbsp; However this might be, there was
so much obscurity and uncertainty about her, and her figure
agreed so well with the desolation of the place, that we were
indebted to the chance of her being there for some of the most
interesting feelings that we had ever had from natural objects
connected with man in dreary solitariness.</p>
<p>We had been advised to go along the <i>new</i> road, which
would have carried us down the vale; but we met some <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>travellers who recommended us to climb the hill, and go
by the village of Crawfordjohn as being much nearer.&nbsp; We had
a long hill, and after having reached the top, steep and bad
roads, so we continued to walk for a considerable way.&nbsp; The
air was cold and clear&mdash;the sky blue.&nbsp; We walked
cheerfully along in the sunshine, each of us alone, only William
had the charge of the horse and car, so he sometimes took a ride,
which did but poorly recompense him for the trouble of
driving.&nbsp; I never travelled with more cheerful spirits than
this day.&nbsp; Our road was along the side of a high moor.&nbsp;
I can always walk over a moor with a light foot; I seem to be
drawn more closely to nature in such places than anywhere else;
or rather I feel more strongly the power of nature over me, and
am better satisfied with myself for being able to find enjoyment
in what unfortunately to many persons is either dismal or
insipid.&nbsp; This moor, however, was more than commonly
interesting; we could see a long way, and on every side of us
were larger or smaller tracts of cultivated land.&nbsp; Some were
extensive farms, yet in so large a waste they did but look small,
with farm-houses, barns, etc., others like little cottages, with
enough to feed a cow, and supply the family with
vegetables.&nbsp; In looking at these farms we had always one
feeling.&nbsp; Why did the plough stop there?&nbsp; Why might not
they as well have carried it twice as far?&nbsp; There were no
hedgerows near the farms, and very few trees.&nbsp; As we were
passing along, we saw an old man, the first we had seen in a
Highland bonnet, walking with a staff at a very slow pace by the
edge of one of the moorland cornfields; he wore a grey plaid, and
a dog was by his side.&nbsp; There was a scriptural solemnity in
this man&rsquo;s figure, a sober simplicity which was most
impressive.&nbsp; Scotland <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>is the
country above all others that I have seen, in which a man of
imagination may carve out his own pleasures.&nbsp; There are so
many <i>inhabited</i> solitudes, and the employments of the
people are so immediately connected with the places where you
find them, and their dresses so simple, so much alike, yet, from
their being folding garments, admitting of an endless variety,
and falling often so gracefully.</p>
<p>After some time we descended towards a broad vale, passed one
farm-house, sheltered by fir trees, with a burn close to it;
children playing, linen bleaching.&nbsp; The vale was open
pastures and corn-fields unfenced, the land poor.&nbsp; The
village of Crawfordjohn on the slope of a hill a long way before
us to the left.&nbsp; Asked about our road of a man who was
driving a cart; he told us to go through the village, then along
some fields, and we should come to a &lsquo;herd&rsquo;s house by
the burn side.&rsquo;&nbsp; The highway was right through the
vale, unfenced on either side; the people of the village, who
were making hay, all stared at us and our carriage.&nbsp; We
inquired the road of a middle-aged man, dressed in a shabby black
coat, at work in one of the hay fields; he looked like the
minister of the place, and when he spoke we felt assured that he
was so, for he was not sparing of hard words, which, however, he
used with great propriety, and he spoke like one who had been
accustomed to dictate.&nbsp; Our car wanted mending in the wheel,
and we asked him if there was a blacksmith in the village.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, but when we showed him the wheel
he told William that he might mend it himself without a
blacksmith, and he would put him in the way; so he fetched hammer
and nails and gave his directions, which William obeyed, and
repaired the damage entirely to his own satisfaction and the
priest&rsquo;s, who did not offer to lend any <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>assistance
himself; not as if he would not have been willing in case of
need; but as if it were more natural for him to dictate, and
because he thought it more fit that William should do it
himself.&nbsp; He spoke much about the propriety of every
man&rsquo;s lending all the assistance in his power to
travellers, and with some ostentation or self-praise.&nbsp; Here
I observed a honey-suckle and some flowers growing in a garden,
the first I had seen in Scotland.&nbsp; It is a pretty
cheerful-looking village, but must be very cold in winter; it
stands on a hillside, and the vale itself is very high ground,
unsheltered by trees.</p>
<p>Left the village behind us, and our road led through arable
ground for a considerable way, on which were growing very good
crops of corn and potatoes.&nbsp; Our friend accompanied us to
show us the way, and Coleridge and he had a scientific
conversation concerning the uses and properties of lime and other
manures.&nbsp; He seemed to be a well-informed man; somewhat
pedantic in his manners; but this might be only the difference
between Scotch and English. <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>Soon after he had parted from us, we came upon a stony, rough
road over a black moor; and presently to the &lsquo;herd&rsquo;s
house by the burn side.&rsquo;&nbsp; We could hardly cross the
burn dry-shod, over which was the only road to the cottage.&nbsp;
In England there would have been stepping-stones or a bridge; but
the Scotch need not be afraid of wetting their bare feet.&nbsp;
The hut had its little kail-garth fenced with earth; there was no
other enclosure&mdash;but the common, heathy with coarse
grass.&nbsp; Travelled along the common for some miles, before we
joined the great road from Longtown to Glasgow&mdash;saw on the
bare hill-sides at a distance, sometimes a <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>solitary
farm, now and then a plantation, and one very large wood, with an
appearance of richer ground above; but it was so very high we
could not think it possible.&nbsp; Having descended considerably,
the common was no longer of a peat-mossy brown heath colour, but
grass with rushes was its chief produce; there was sometimes a
solitary hut, no enclosures except the kail-garth, and sheep
pasturing in flocks, with shepherd-boys tending them.&nbsp; I
remember one boy in particular; he had no hat on, and only had a
grey plaid wrapped about him.&nbsp; It is nothing to describe,
but on a bare moor, alone with his sheep, standing, as he did, in
utter quietness and silence, there was something uncommonly
impressive in his appearance, a solemnity which recalled to our
minds the old man in the corn-field.&nbsp; We passed many people
who were mowing, or raking the grass of the common; it was little
better than rushes; but they did not mow straight forward, only
here and there, where it was the best; in such a place hay-cocks
had an uncommon appearance to us.</p>
<p>After a long descent we came to some plantations which were
not far from Douglas Mill.&nbsp; The country for some time had
been growing into cultivation, and now it was a wide vale with
large tracts of corn; trees in clumps, no hedgerows, which always
make a country look bare and unlovely.&nbsp; For my part, I was
better pleased with the desert places we had left behind, though
no doubt the inhabitants of this place think it &lsquo;a varra
bonny spot,&rsquo; for the Scotch are always pleased with their
own abode, be it what it may; and afterwards at Edinburgh, when
we were talking with a bookseller of our travels, he observed
that it was &lsquo;a fine country near Douglas Mill.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Douglas Mill is a single house, a large inn, being one of the
regular stages between <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Longtown and Glasgow, and therefore a
fair specimen of the best of the country inns of Scotland.&nbsp;
As soon as our car stopped at the door we felt the
difference.&nbsp; At an English inn of this size, a waiter, or
the master or mistress, would have been at the door immediately,
but we remained some time before anybody came; then a barefooted
lass made her appearance, but she only looked at us and went
away.&nbsp; The mistress, a remarkably handsome woman, showed us
into a large parlour; we ordered mutton-chops, and I finished my
letter to Mary; writing on the same window-ledge on which William
had written to me two years before.</p>
<p>After dinner, William and I sat by a little mill-race in the
garden.&nbsp; We had left Leadhills and Wanlockhead far above us,
and now were come into a warmer climate; but there was no
richness in the face of the country.&nbsp; The shrubs looked cold
and poor, and yet there were some very fine trees within a little
distance of Douglas Mill, so that the reason, perhaps, why the
few low shrubs and trees which were growing in the gardens seemed
to be so unluxuriant, might be, that there being no hedgerows,
the general appearance of the country was naked, and I could not
help seeing the same coldness where, perhaps, it did not exist in
itself to any great degree, for the corn crops are abundant, and
I should think the soil is not bad.&nbsp; While we were sitting
at the door, two of the landlady&rsquo;s children came out; the
elder, a boy about six years old, was running away from his
little brother, in petticoats; the ostler called out,
&lsquo;Sandy, tak&rsquo; your wee brither wi&rsquo; you;&rsquo;
another voice from the window, &lsquo;Sawny, dinna leave your wee
brither;&rsquo; the mother then came, &lsquo;Alexander,
tak&rsquo; your wee brother by the hand;&rsquo; Alexander obeyed,
and the two went off in peace together.&nbsp; We were charged
eightpence for hay at this inn, <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>another
symptom of our being in Scotland.&nbsp; Left Douglas Mill at
about three o&rsquo;clock; travelled through an open corn
country, the tracts of corn large and unenclosed.&nbsp; We often
passed women or children who were watching a single cow while it
fed upon the slips of grass between the corn.&nbsp; William asked
a strong woman, about thirty years of age, who looked like the
mistress of a family&mdash;I suppose moved by some sentiment of
compassion for her being so employed,&mdash;if the cow would eat
the corn if it were left to itself: she smiled at his
simplicity.&nbsp; It is indeed a melancholy thing to see a
full-grown woman thus waiting, as it were, body and soul devoted
to the poor beast; yet even this is better than working in a
manufactory the day through.</p>
<p>We came to a moorish tract; saw before us the hills of Loch
Lomond, Ben Lomond and another, distinct each by itself.&nbsp;
Not far from the roadside were some benches placed in rows in the
middle of a large field, with a sort of covered shed like a
sentry-box, but much more like those boxes which the Italian
puppet-showmen in London use.&nbsp; We guessed that it was a
pulpit or tent for preaching, and were told that a sect met there
occasionally, who held that toleration was unscriptural, and
would have all religions but their own exterminated.&nbsp; I have
forgotten what name the man gave to this sect; we could not learn
that it differed in any other respect from the Church of
Scotland.&nbsp; Travelled for some miles along the open country,
which was all without hedgerows, sometimes arable, sometimes
moorish, and often whole tracts covered with grunsel. <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; There was one field, which one
might have believed had been sown with grunsel, it was so
regularly covered with it&mdash;a large square field upon a
slope, its boundary marked to <!-- page 31--><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>our eyes only
by the termination of the bright yellow; contiguous to it were
other fields of the same size and shape, one of clover, the other
of potatoes, all equally regular crops.&nbsp; The oddness of this
appearance, the grunsel being uncommonly luxuriant, and the field
as yellow as gold, made William laugh.&nbsp; Coleridge was
melancholy upon it, observing that there was land enough wasted
to rear a healthy child.</p>
<p>We left behind us, considerably to the right, a single high
mountain; <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a> I have forgotten its name; we had had
it long in view.&nbsp; Saw before us the river Clyde, its course
at right angles to our road, which now made a turn, running
parallel with the river; the town of Lanerk in sight long before
we came to it.&nbsp; I was somewhat disappointed with the first
view of the Clyde: <a name="citation31b"></a><a
href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a> the banks, though
swelling and varied, had a poverty in their appearance, chiefly
from the want of wood and hedgerows.&nbsp; Crossed the river and
ascended towards Lanerk, which stands upon a hill.&nbsp; When we
were within about a mile of the town, William parted from
Coleridge and me, to go to the celebrated waterfalls.&nbsp;
Coleridge did not attempt to drive the horse; but led him all the
way.&nbsp; We inquired for the best inn, and were told that the
New Inn was the best; but that they had very &lsquo;genteel
apartments&rsquo; at the Black Bull, and made less charges, and
the Black Bull was at the entrance of the town, so we thought we
would stop there, as the horse was obstinate and weary.&nbsp; But
when we came to the Black Bull we had no wish to enter the
apartments; for it seemed the abode of dirt and poverty, yet it
was a large building.&nbsp; The town showed a sort of French
face, and would have done much more, had it not been for the true
British tinge <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of coal-smoke; the doors and windows
dirty, the shops dull, the women too seemed to be very dirty in
their dress.&nbsp; The town itself is not ugly; the houses are of
grey stone, the streets not very narrow, and the market-place
decent.&nbsp; The New Inn is a handsome old stone building,
formerly a gentleman&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; We were conducted into
a parlour, where people had been drinking; the tables were
unwiped, chairs in disorder, the floor dirty, and the smell of
liquors was most offensive.&nbsp; We were tired, however, and
rejoiced in our tea.</p>
<p>The evening sun was now sending a glorious light through the
street, which ran from west to east; the houses were of a fire
red, and the faces of the people as they walked westward were
almost like a blacksmith when he is at work by night.&nbsp; I
longed to be out, and meet with William, that we might see the
Falls before the day was gone.&nbsp; Poor Coleridge was unwell,
and could not go.&nbsp; I inquired my road, and a little girl
told me she would go with me to the porter&rsquo;s lodge, where I
might be admitted.&nbsp; I was grieved to hear that the Falls of
the Clyde were shut up in a gentleman&rsquo;s grounds, and to be
viewed only by means of lock and key.&nbsp; Much, however, as the
pure feeling with which one would desire to visit such places is
disturbed by useless, impertinent, or even unnecessary
interference with nature, yet when I was there the next morning I
seemed to feel it a less disagreeable thing than in smaller and
more delicate spots, if I may use the phrase.&nbsp; My guide, a
sensible little girl, answered my inquiries very prettily.&nbsp;
She was eight years old, read in the &lsquo;Collection,&rsquo; a
book which all the Scotch children whom I have questioned read
in.&nbsp; I found it was a collection of hymns; she could repeat
several of Dr. Watts&rsquo;.&nbsp; We passed through a great <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>part of the town, then turned down a steep hill, and
came in view of a long range of cotton mills, <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> the largest and loftiest I had ever
seen; climbed upwards again, our road leading us along the top of
the left bank of the river; both banks very steep and richly
wooded.&nbsp; The girl left me at the porter&rsquo;s lodge.&nbsp;
Having asked after William, I was told that no person had been
there, or could enter but by the gate.&nbsp; The night was coming
on, therefore I did not venture to go in, as I had no hope of
meeting William.&nbsp; I had a delicious walk alone through the
wood; the sound of the water was very solemn, and even the cotton
mills in the fading light of evening had somewhat of the majesty
and stillness of the natural objects.&nbsp; It was nearly dark
when I reached the inn.&nbsp; I found Coleridge sitting by a good
fire, which always makes an inn room look comfortable.&nbsp; In a
few minutes William arrived; he had heard of me at the gate, and
followed as quickly as he could, shouting after me.&nbsp; He was
pale and exceedingly tired.</p>
<p>After he had left us he had taken a wrong road, and while
looking about to set himself right had met with a barefooted boy,
who said he would go with him.&nbsp; The little fellow carried
him by a wild path to the upper of the Falls, the Boniton Linn,
and coming down unexpectedly upon it, he was exceedingly affected
by the solemn grandeur of the place.&nbsp; This fall is not much
admired or spoken of by travellers; you have never a full, breast
view of it; it does not make a complete self-satisfying place, an
abode of its own, as a perfect waterfall seems to me to do; but
the river, down which you look through a long vista of steep and
ruin-like rocks, the roaring of the waterfall, and the solemn
evening lights, must have been most impressive.&nbsp; One of the
rocks on the near bank, even in broad daylight, as we <!-- page
34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>saw
it the next morning, is exactly like the fractured arch of an
abbey.&nbsp; With the lights and shadows of evening upon it, the
resemblance must have been much more striking.</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s guide was a pretty boy, and he was exceedingly
pleased with him.&nbsp; Just as they were quitting the waterfall,
William&rsquo;s mind being full of the majesty of the scene, the
little fellow pointed to the top of a rock, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
a fine slae-bush there.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; said
William, &lsquo;but there are no slaes upon it,&rsquo; which was
true enough; but I suppose the child remembered the slaes of
another summer, though, as he said, he was but &lsquo;half seven
years old,&rsquo; namely, six and a half.&nbsp; He conducted
William to the other fall, and as they were going along a narrow
path, they came to a small cavern, where William lost him, and
looking about, saw his pretty figure in a sort of natural niche
fitted for a statue, from which the boy jumped out laughing,
delighted with the success of his trick.&nbsp; William told us a
great deal about him, while he sat by the fire, and of the
pleasure of his walk, often repeating, &lsquo;I wish you had been
with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having no change, he gave the boy sixpence,
which was certainly, if he had formed any expectations at all,
far beyond them; but he received it with the utmost indifference,
without any remark of surprise or pleasure; most likely he did
not know how many halfpence he could get for it, and twopence
would have pleased him more.&nbsp; My little girl was delighted
with the sixpence I gave her, and said she would buy a book with
it on Monday morning.&nbsp; What a difference between the manner
of living and education of boys and of girls among the lower
classes of people in towns! she had never seen the Falls of the
Clyde, nor had ever been further than the porter&rsquo;s lodge;
the boy, I daresay, knew every hiding-place in every accessible
rock, as well as the fine &lsquo;slae bushes&rsquo; and the nut
trees.</p>
<h2><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>SECOND WEEK.</h2>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>August</i> 21<i>st</i>.&mdash;The morning
was very hot, a morning to tempt us to linger by the
water-side.&nbsp; I wished to have had the day before us,
expecting so much from what William had seen; but when we went
there, I did not desire to stay longer than till the hour which
we had prescribed to ourselves; for it was a rule not to be
broken in upon, that the person who conducted us to the Falls was
to remain by our side till we chose to depart.&nbsp; We left our
inn immediately after breakfast.&nbsp; The lanes were full of
people going to church; many of the middle-aged women wore long
scarlet cardinals, and were without hats: they brought to my mind
the women of Goslar as they used to go to church in their silver
or gold caps, with their long cloaks, black or coloured.</p>
<p>The banks of the Clyde from Lanerk to the Falls rise
immediately from the river; they are lofty and steep, and covered
with wood.&nbsp; The road to the Falls is along the top of one of
the banks, and to the left you have a prospect of the open
country, corn fields and scattered houses.&nbsp; To the right,
over the river, the country spreads out, as it were, into a plain
covered over with hills, no one hill much higher than another,
but hills all over; there were endless pastures overgrown with
broom, and scattered trees, without hedges or fences of any kind,
and no distinct footpaths.&nbsp; It was delightful to see the
lasses in gay dresses running <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>like cattle
among the broom, making their way straight forward towards the
river, here and there as it might chance.&nbsp; They waded across
the stream, and, when they had reached the top of the opposite
bank, sat down by the road-side, about half a mile from the town,
to put on their shoes and cotton stockings, which they brought
tied up in pocket-handkerchiefs.&nbsp; The porter&rsquo;s lodge
is about a mile from Lanerk, and the lady&rsquo;s house&mdash;for
the whole belongs to a lady, whose name I have forgotten <a
name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a>&mdash;is upon a hill at a little
distance.&nbsp; We walked, after we had entered the private
grounds, perhaps two hundred yards along a gravel carriage-road,
then came to a little side gate, which opened upon a narrow
gravel path under trees, and in a minute and a half, or less,
were directly opposite to the great waterfall.&nbsp; I was much
affected by the first view of it.&nbsp; The majesty and strength
of the water, for I had never before seen so large a cataract,
struck me with astonishment, which died away, giving place to
more delightful feelings; though there were some buildings that I
could have wished had not been there, though at first
unnoticed.&nbsp; The chief of them was a neat, white, lady-like
house, <a name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a> very near to the waterfall.&nbsp;
William and Coleridge however were in a better and perhaps wiser
humour, and did not dislike the house; indeed, it was a very
nice-looking place, with a moderate-sized garden, leaving the
green fields free and open.&nbsp; This house is on the side of
the river opposite to the grand house and the
pleasure-grounds.&nbsp; The waterfall Cora Linn <a
name="citation36c"></a><a href="#footnote36c"
class="citation">[36c]</a> is composed of two falls, with a
sloping space, which <i>appears</i> to be about twenty yards
between, but is much more.&nbsp; The basin which receives the
fall is enclosed by noble rocks, with trees, chiefly hazels,
birch, <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and ash growing out of their sides
whenever there is any hold for them; and a magnificent
resting-place it is for such a river; I think more grand than the
Falls themselves.</p>
<p>After having stayed some time, we returned by the same
footpath into the main carriage-road, and soon came upon what
William calls an ell-wide gravel walk, from which we had
different views of the Linn.&nbsp; We sat upon a bench, placed
for the sake of one of these views, whence we looked down upon
the waterfall, and over the open country, and saw a ruined tower,
called Wallace&rsquo;s Tower, which stands at a very little
distance from the fall, and is an interesting object.&nbsp; A
lady and gentleman, more expeditious tourists than ourselves,
came to the spot; they left us at the seat, and we found them
again at another station above the Falls.&nbsp; Coleridge, who is
always good-natured enough to enter into conversation with
anybody whom he meets in his way, began to talk with the
gentleman, who observed that it was a <i>majestic</i>
waterfall.&nbsp; Coleridge was delighted with the accuracy of the
epithet, particularly as he had been settling in his own mind the
precise meaning of the words grand, majestic, sublime, etc., and
had discussed the subject with William at some length the day
before.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; says Coleridge, &lsquo;it
<i>is</i> a majestic waterfall.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sublime and
beautiful,&rsquo; replied his friend.&nbsp; Poor Coleridge could
make no answer, and, not very desirous to continue the
conversation, came to us and related the story, laughing
heartily.</p>
<p>The distance from one Linn to the other may be half a mile or
more, along the same ell-wide walk.&nbsp; We came to a
pleasure-house, of which the little girl had the key; she said it
was called the Fog-house, because it was lined with
&lsquo;fog,&rsquo; namely moss.&nbsp; On the outside it resembled
some of the huts in the prints belonging to Captain Cook&rsquo;s
Voyages, <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and within was like a hay-stack
scooped out.&nbsp; It was circular, with a dome-like roof, a seat
all round fixed to the wall, and a table in the
middle,&mdash;seat, wall, roof and table all covered with moss in
the neatest manner possible.&nbsp; It was as snug as a
bird&rsquo;s nest; I wish we had such a one at the top of our
orchard, only a great deal smaller.&nbsp; We afterwards found
that huts of the same kind were common in the pleasure-grounds of
Scotland; but we never saw any that were so beautifully wrought
as this.&nbsp; It had, however, little else to recommend it, the
situation being chosen without judgment; there was no prospect
from it, nor was it a place of seclusion and retirement, for it
stood close to the ell-wide gravel walk.&nbsp; We wished we could
have shoved it about a hundred yards further on, when we arrived
at a bench which was also close to the walk, for just below the
bench, the walk elbowing out into a circle, there was a beautiful
spring of clear water, which we could see rise up continually, at
the bottom of a round stone basin full to the brim, the water
gushing out at a little outlet and passing away under the
walk.&nbsp; A reason was wanted for placing the hut where it is;
what a good one would this little spring have furnished for
bringing it hither!&nbsp; Along the whole of the path were
openings at intervals for views of the river, but, as almost
always happens in gentlemen&rsquo;s grounds, they were
injudiciously managed; you were prepared for a dead
stand&mdash;by a parapet, a painted seat, or some other
device.</p>
<p>We stayed some time at the Boniton Fall, which has one great
advantage over the other falls, that it is at the termination of
the pleasure-grounds, and we see no traces of the boundary-line;
yet, except under some accidental circumstances, such as a sunset
like that of the preceding <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>evening, it
is greatly inferior to the Cora Linn.&nbsp; We returned to the
inn to dinner.&nbsp; The landlord set the first dish upon the
table, as is common in England, and we were well waited
upon.&nbsp; This first dish was true Scottish&mdash;a boiled
sheep&rsquo;s head, with the hair singed off; Coleridge and I ate
heartily of it; we had barley broth, in which the sheep&rsquo;s
head had been boiled.&nbsp; A party of tourists whom we had met
in the pleasure-grounds drove from the door while we were waiting
for dinner; I guess they were fresh from England, for they had
stuffed the pockets of their carriage with bundles of heather,
roots and all, just as if Scotland grew no heather but on the
banks of the Clyde.&nbsp; They passed away with their treasure
towards Loch Lomond.&nbsp; A party of boys, dressed all alike in
blue, very neat, were standing at the chaise-door; we conjectured
they were charity scholars; but found on inquiry that they were
apprentices to the cotton factory; we were told that they were
well instructed in reading and writing.&nbsp; We had seen in the
morning a flock of girls dressed in grey coming out of the
factory, probably apprentices also.</p>
<p>After dinner set off towards Hamilton, but on foot, for we had
to turn aside to the Cartland Rocks, and our car was to meet us
on the road.&nbsp; A guide attended us, who might almost in size,
and certainly in activity, have been compared with
William&rsquo;s companion who hid himself in the niche of the
cavern.&nbsp; His method of walking and very quick step soon
excited our attention.&nbsp; I could hardly keep up with him; he
paddled by our side, just reaching to my shoulder, like a little
dog, with his long snout pushed before him&mdash;for he had an
enormous nose, and walked with his head foremost.&nbsp; I said to
him, &lsquo;How quick you walk!&rsquo; he replied,
&lsquo;<i>That</i> was <i>not</i> quick walking,&rsquo; and when
I asked <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>him what he called so, he said
&lsquo;Five miles an hour,&rsquo; and then related in how many
hours he had lately walked from Lanerk to Edinburgh, done some
errands, and returned to Lanerk&mdash;I have forgotten the
particulars, but it was a very short time&mdash;and added that he
had an old father who could walk at the rate of four miles an
hour, for twenty-four miles, any day, and had never had an
hour&rsquo;s sickness in his life.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;he has not drunk much strong liquor?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, enough to drown him.&rsquo;&nbsp; From his eager
manner of uttering this, I inferred that he himself was a
drinker; and the man who met us with the car told William that he
gained a great deal of money as an errand-goer, but spent it all
in tippling.&nbsp; He had been a shoemaker, but could not bear
the confinement on account of a weakness in his chest.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Lanerk is exceedingly pleasant; we came
to a sort of district of glens or little valleys that cleave the
hills, leaving a cheerful, open country above them, with no
superior hills, but an undulating surface.&nbsp; Our guide
pointed to the situation of the Cartland Crags.&nbsp; We were to
cross a narrow valley, and walk down on the other side, and then
we should be at the spot; but the little fellow made a sharp turn
down a footpath to the left, saying, &lsquo;We must have some
conversation here.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paddled on with his small
pawing feet till we came right opposite to a gentleman&rsquo;s
house on the other side of the valley, when he halted, repeating
some words, I have forgotten what, which were taken up by the
most distinct echo I ever heard&mdash;this is saying little: it
was the most distinct echo that it is possible to conceive.&nbsp;
It shouted the names of our fireside friends in the very tone in
which William and Coleridge spoke; but it seemed to <!-- page
41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>make
a joke of me, and I could not help laughing at my own voice, it
was so shrill and pert, exactly as if some one had been mimicking
it very successfully, with an intention of making me
ridiculous.&nbsp; I wished Joanna <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> had been there to
laugh, for the echo is an excellent laugher, and would have
almost made her believe that it was a true story which William
has told of her and the mountains.&nbsp; We turned back, crossed
the valley, went through the orchard and plantations belonging to
the gentleman&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; By the bye, we observed to our
guide that the echo must bring many troublesome visitors to
disturb the quiet of the owner of that house.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh
no,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;he glories in much
company.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a native of that neighbourhood, had
made a moderate fortune abroad, purchased an estate, built the
house, and raised the plantations; and further, had made a
convenient walk through his woods to the Cartland Crags.&nbsp;
The house was modest and neat, and though not adorned in the best
taste, and though the plantations were of fir, we looked at it
with great pleasure, there was such true liberality and
kind-heartedness in leaving his orchard path open, and his walks
unobstructed by gates.&nbsp; I hope this goodness is not often
abused by plunderers of the apple-trees, which were hung with
tempting apples close to the path.</p>
<p>At the termination of the little valley, we descended through
a wood along a very steep path to a muddy stream running over
limestone rocks; turned up to the left along the bed of the
stream, and soon we were closed in by rocks on each side.&nbsp;
They were very lofty&mdash;of limestone, trees starting out of
them, high and low, overhanging the stream or shooting up towards
the sky.&nbsp; No place of the kind could be more beautiful if
the stream had been clear, <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>but it was of
a muddy yellow colour; had it been a large river, one might have
got the better of the unpleasantness of the muddy water in the
grandeur of its roaring, the boiling up of the foam over the
rocks, or the obscurity of its pools.</p>
<p>We had been told that the Cartland Crags were better worth
going to see than the Falls of the Clyde.&nbsp; I did not think
so; but I have seen rocky dells resembling this before, with
clear water instead of that muddy stream, and never saw anything
like the Falls of the Clyde.&nbsp; It would be a delicious spot
to have near one&rsquo;s house; one would linger out many a day
in the cool shade of the caverns, and the stream would soothe one
by its murmuring; still, being an old friend, one would not love
it the less for its homely face.&nbsp; Even we, as we passed
along, could not help stopping for a long while to admire the
beauty of the lazy foam, for ever in motion, and never moved
away, in a still place of the water, covering the whole surface
of it with streaks and lines and ever-varying circles.&nbsp; Wild
marjoram grew upon the rocks in great perfection and beauty; our
guide gave me a bunch, and said he should come hither to collect
a store for tea for the winter, and that it was &lsquo;varra
hale-some:&rsquo; he drank none else.&nbsp; We walked perhaps
half a mile along the bed of the river; but it might <i>seem</i>
to be much further than it was, owing to the difficulty of the
path, and the sharp and many turnings of the glen.&nbsp; Passed
two of Wallace&rsquo;s Caves.&nbsp; There is scarce a noted glen
in Scotland that has not a cave for Wallace or some other
hero.&nbsp; Before we left the river the rocks became less lofty,
turned into a wood through which was a convenient path upwards,
met the owner of the house and the echo-ground, and thanked him
for the pleasure which he had provided <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>for us and
other travellers by making such pretty pathways.</p>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock when we reached the place where the
car was waiting.&nbsp; We were anxious to be off, as we had
fifteen miles to go; but just as we were seating ourselves we
found that the cushions were missing.&nbsp; William was forced to
go back to the town, a mile at least, and Coleridge and I waited
with the car.&nbsp; It rained, and we had some fear that the
evening would be wet, but the rain soon ceased, though the sky
continued gloomy&mdash;an unfortunate circumstance, for we had to
travel through a beautiful country, and of that sort which is
most set off by sunshine and pleasant weather.</p>
<p>Travelled through the Vale or <i>Trough</i> of the Clyde, as
it is called, for ten or eleven miles, having the river on our
right.&nbsp; We had fine views both up and down the river for the
first three or four miles, our road being not close to it, but
above its banks, along the open country, which was here
occasionally intersected by hedgerows.</p>
<p>Left our car in the road, and turned down a field to the Fall
of Stonebyres, another of the falls of the Clyde, which I had not
heard spoken of; therefore it gave me the more pleasure.&nbsp; We
saw it from the top of the bank of the river at a little
distance.&nbsp; It has not the imposing majesty of Cora Linn; but
it has the advantage of being left to itself, a grand solitude in
the heart of a populous country.&nbsp; We had a prospect above
and below it, of cultivated grounds, with hay-stacks, houses,
hills; but the river&rsquo;s banks were lonesome, steep, and
woody, with rocks near the fall.</p>
<p>A little further on, came more into company with the river;
sometimes we were close to it, sometimes above it, <!-- page
44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>but
always at no great distance; and now the vale became more
interesting and amusing.&nbsp; It is very populous, with
villages, hamlets, single cottages, or farm-houses embosomed in
orchards, and scattered over with gentlemen&rsquo;s houses, some
of them very ugly, tall and obtrusive, others neat and
comfortable.&nbsp; We seemed now to have got into a country where
poverty and riches were shaking hands together; pears and apples,
of which the crop was abundant, hung over the road, often growing
in orchards unfenced; or there might be bunches of broom along
the road-side in an interrupted line, that looked like a hedge
till we came to it and saw the gaps.&nbsp; Bordering on these
fruitful orchards perhaps would be a patch, its chief produce
being gorse or broom.&nbsp; There was nothing like a moor or
common anywhere; but small plots of uncultivated ground were left
high and low, among the potatoes, corn, cabbages, which grew
intermingled, now among trees, now bare.&nbsp; The Trough of the
Clyde is, indeed, a singular and very interesting region; it is
somewhat like the upper part of the vale of Nith, but above the
Nith is much less cultivated ground&mdash;without hedgerows or
orchards, or anything that looks like a rich country.&nbsp; We
met crowds of people coming from the kirk; the lasses were gaily
dressed, often in white gowns, coloured satin bonnets, and
coloured silk handkerchiefs, and generally with their shoes and
stockings in a bundle hung on their arm.&nbsp; Before we left the
river the vale became much less interesting, resembling a poor
English country, the fields being large, and unluxuriant
hedges.</p>
<p>It had been dark long before we reached Hamilton, and William
had some difficulty in driving the tired horse through the
town.&nbsp; At the inn they hesitated about being able to give us
beds, the house being brim-full&mdash;lights at <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>every
window.&nbsp; We were rather alarmed for our accommodations
during the rest of the tour, supposing the house to be filled
with <i>tourists</i>; but they were in general only regular
travellers for out of the main road from town to town we saw
scarcely a carriage, and the inns were empty.&nbsp; There was
nothing remarkable in the treatment we met with at this inn,
except the lazy impertinence of the waiter.&nbsp; It was a
townish place, with a great larder set out; the house throughout
dirty.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Monday</i>, <i>August</i> 22<i>d</i>.&mdash;Immediately
after breakfast walked to the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s house to
view the picture-gallery, chiefly the famous picture of Daniel in
the Lions&rsquo; Den, by Rubens.&nbsp; It is a large building,
without grandeur, a heavy, lumpish mass, after the fashion of the
Hopetoun H, <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> only five times the size, and with
longer legs, which makes it gloomy.&nbsp; We entered the gate,
passed the porter&rsquo;s lodge, where we saw nobody, and stopped
at the front door, as William had done two years before with Sir
William Rush&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; We were met by a little
mean-looking man, shabbily dressed, out of livery, who, we found,
was the porter.&nbsp; After scanning us over, he told us that we
ought not to have come to that door.&nbsp; We said we were sorry
for the mistake, but as one of our party had been there two years
before, and was admitted by the same entrance, we had supposed it
was the regular way.&nbsp; After many hesitations, and having
kept us five minutes waiting in the large hall, while he went to
consult with the housekeeper, he informed us that we could not be
admitted at that time, the housekeeper being unwell; but that we
might return in an hour: <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>he then
conducted us through long gloomy passages to an obscure door at
the corner of the house.&nbsp; We asked if we might be permitted
to walk in the park in the meantime; and he told us that this
would not be agreeable to the Duke&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; We
returned to the inn discontented enough, but resolved not to
waste an hour, if there were anything else in the neighbourhood
worth seeing.&nbsp; The waiter told us there was a curious place
called Baroncleugh, with gardens cut out in rocks, and we
determined to go thither.&nbsp; We had to walk through the town,
which may be about as large as Penrith, and perhaps a mile
further, along a dusty turnpike road.&nbsp; The morning was hot,
sunny, and windy, and we were half tired before we reached the
place; but were amply repaid for our trouble.</p>
<p>The general face of the country near Hamilton is much in the
ordinary English style; not very hilly, with hedgerows, corn
fields, and stone houses.&nbsp; The Clyde is here an open river
with low banks, and the country spreads out so wide that there is
no appearance of a regular vale.&nbsp; Baroncleugh is in a
beautiful deep glen through which runs the river Avon, a stream
that falls into the Clyde.&nbsp; The house stands very sweetly in
complete retirement; it has its gardens and terraces one above
another, with flights of steps between, box-trees and yew-trees
cut in fantastic shapes, flower-borders and summer-houses; and,
still below, apples and pears were hanging in abundance on the
branches of large old trees, which grew intermingled with the
natural wood, elms, beeches, etc., even to the water&rsquo;s
edge.&nbsp; The whole place is in perfect harmony with the taste
of our ancestors, and the yews and hollies are shaven as nicely,
and the gravel walks and flower-borders kept in as exact order,
as if the spirit of the first architect of the terraces still
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>presided over them.&nbsp; The opposite bank of the river
is left in its natural wildness, and nothing was to be seen
higher up but the deep dell, its steep banks being covered with
fine trees, a beautiful relief or contrast to the garden, which
is one of the most elaborate old things ever seen, a little
hanging garden of Babylon.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear that the owner of this sweet place did not
live there always.&nbsp; He had built a small thatched house to
eke out the old one: it was a neat dwelling, with no false
ornaments.&nbsp; We were exceedingly sorry to quit this spot,
which is left to nature and past times, and should have liked to
have pursued the glen further up; we were told that there was a
ruined castle; and the walk itself must be very delightful; but
we wished to reach Glasgow in good time, and had to go again to
Hamilton House.&nbsp; Returned to the town by a much shorter
road, and were very angry with the waiter for not having directed
us to it; but he was too great a man to speak three words more
than he could help.</p>
<p>We stopped at the proper door of the Duke&rsquo;s house, and
seated ourselves humbly upon a bench, waiting the pleasure of the
porter, who, after a little time, informed us that we could not
be admitted, giving no reason whatever.&nbsp; When we got to the
inn, we could just gather from the waiter that it was not usual
to refuse admittance to strangers; but that was all: he could
not, or would not, help us, so we were obliged to give it up,
which mortified us, for I had wished much to see the
picture.&nbsp; William vowed that he would write that very night
to Lord Archibald Hamilton, stating the whole matter, which he
did from Glasgow.</p>
<p>I ought to have mentioned the park, though, as we were not
allowed to walk there, we saw but little of it.&nbsp; It looked
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>pleasant, as all parks with fine trees must be, but, as
it seemed to be only a large, nearly level, plain, it could not
be a particularly beautiful park, though it borders upon the
Clyde, and the Avon runs, I believe, through it, after leaving
the solitude of the glen of Baroncleugh.</p>
<p>Quitted Hamilton at about eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; There is
nothing interesting between Hamilton and Glasgow till we came to
Bothwell Castle, a few miles from Hamilton.&nbsp; The country is
cultivated, but not rich, the fields large, a perfect contrast to
the huddling together of hills and trees, corn and pasture
grounds, hay-stacks, cottages, orchards, broom and gorse, but
chiefly broom, that had amused us so much the evening before in
passing through the Trough of the Clyde.&nbsp; A native of
Scotland would not probably be satisfied with the account I have
given of the Trough of the Clyde, for it is one of the most
celebrated scenes in Scotland.&nbsp; We certainly received less
pleasure from it than we had expected; but it was plain that this
was chiefly owing to the unfavourable circumstances under which
we saw it&mdash;a gloomy sky and a cold blighting wind.&nbsp; It
is a very beautiful district, yet there, as in all the other
scenes of Scotland celebrated for their fertility, we found
something which gave us a notion of barrenness, of what was not
altogether genial.&nbsp; The new fir and larch plantations, here
as in almost every other part of Scotland, contributed not a
little to this effect.</p>
<p>Crossed the Clyde not far from Hamilton, and had the river for
some miles at a distance from us, on our left; but after having
gone, it might be, three miles, we came to a porter&rsquo;s lodge
on the left side of the road, where we were to turn to Bothwell
Castle, which is in Lord Douglas&rsquo;s grounds.&nbsp; The woman
who keeps the gate brought us a <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>book, in
which we wrote down our names.&nbsp; Went about half a mile
before we came to the pleasure-grounds.&nbsp; Came to a large
range of stables, where we were to leave the car; but there was
no one to unyoke the horse, so William was obliged to do it
himself, a task which he performed very awkwardly, being then new
to it.&nbsp; We saw the ruined castle embosomed in trees, passed
the house, and soon found ourselves on the edge of a steep brow
immediately above and overlooking the course of the river Clyde
through a deep hollow between woods and green steeps.&nbsp; We
had approached at right angles from the main road to the place
over a flat, and had seen nothing before us but a nearly level
country terminated by distant slopes, the Clyde hiding himself in
his deep bed.&nbsp; It was exceedingly delightful to come thus
unexpectedly upon such a beautiful region.</p>
<p>The Castle stands nobly, overlooking the Clyde.&nbsp; When we
came up to it I was hurt to see that flower-borders had taken
place of the natural overgrowings of the ruin, the scattered
stones and wild plants.&nbsp; It is a large and grand pile, of
red freestone, harmonizing perfectly with the rocks of the river,
from which, no doubt, it has been hewn.&nbsp; When I was a little
accustomed to the unnaturalness of a modern garden, I could not
help admiring the excessive beauty and luxuriance of some of the
plants, particularly the purple-flowered clematis, and a
broad-leaved creeping plant without flowers, which scrambled up
the castle wall along with the ivy, and spread its vine-like
branches so lavishly that it seemed to be in its natural
situation, and one could not help thinking that, though not
self-planted among the ruins of this country, it must somewhere
have its natural abode in such places.&nbsp; If Bothwell Castle
had not been close to the Douglas mansion we <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>should have
been disgusted with the possessor&rsquo;s miserable conception of
&lsquo;adorning&rsquo; such a venerable ruin; but it is so very
near to the house that of necessity the pleasure-grounds must
have extended beyond it, and perhaps the neatness of a shaven
lawn and the complete desolation natural to a ruin might have
made an unpleasing contrast; and besides, being within the
precincts of the pleasure-grounds, and so very near to the modern
mansion of a noble family, it has forfeited in some degree its
independent majesty, and becomes a tributary to the mansion; its
solitude being interrupted, it has no longer the same command
over the mind in sending it back into past times, or excluding
the ordinary feelings which we bear about us in daily life.&nbsp;
We had then only to regret that the castle and house were so near
to each other; and it was impossible not to regret it; for the
ruin presides in state over the river, far from city or town, as
if it might have had a peculiar privilege to preserve its
memorials of past ages and maintain its own character and
independence for centuries to come.</p>
<p>We sat upon a bench under the high trees, and had beautiful
views of the different reaches of the river above and
below.&nbsp; On the opposite bank, which is finely wooded with
elms and other trees, are the remains of an ancient priory, built
upon a rock: and rock and ruin are so blended together that it is
impossible to separate the one from the other.&nbsp; Nothing can
be more beautiful than the little remnants of this holy place;
elm trees&mdash;for we were near enough to distinguish them by
their branches&mdash;grow out of the walls, and overshadow a
small but very elegant window.&nbsp; It can scarcely be conceived
what a grace the castle and priory impart to each other; and the
river Clyde flows on smooth <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>and unruffled
below, seeming to my thoughts more in harmony with the sober and
stately images of former times, than if it had roared over a
rocky channel, forcing its sound upon the ear.&nbsp; It blended
gently with the warbling of the smaller birds and chattering of
the larger ones that had made their nests in the ruins.&nbsp; In
this fortress the chief of the English nobility were confined
after the battle of Bannockburn.&nbsp; If a man is to be a
prisoner, he scarcely could have a more pleasant place to solace
his captivity; but I thought that for close confinement I should
prefer the banks of a lake or the sea-side.&nbsp; The greatest
charm of a brook or river is in the liberty to pursue it through
its windings; you can then take it in whatever mood you like;
silent or noisy, sportive or quiet.&nbsp; The beauties of a brook
or river must be sought, and the pleasure is in going in search
of them; those of a lake or of the sea come to you of
themselves.&nbsp; These rude warriors cared little perhaps about
either; and yet if one may judge from the writings of Chaucer and
from the old romances, more interesting passions were connected
with natural objects in the days of chivalry than now, though
going in search of scenery, as it is called, had not then been
thought of.&nbsp; I had heard nothing of Bothwell Castle, at
least nothing that I remembered, therefore, perhaps, my pleasure
was greater, compared with what I received elsewhere, than others
might feel.</p>
<p>At our return to the stables we found an inferior groom, who
helped William to yoke the horse, and was very civil.&nbsp; We
grew hungry before we had travelled many miles, and seeing a
large public-house&mdash;it was in a walled court some yards from
the road&mdash;Coleridge got off the car to inquire if we could
dine there, and was told we could have nothing but eggs.&nbsp; It
was a miserable place, very like a French <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>house; indeed
we observed, in almost every part of Scotland, except Edinburgh,
that we were reminded ten times of France and Germany for once of
England.</p>
<p>Saw nothing remarkable after leaving Bothwell, except the
first view of Glasgow, at some miles distance, terminated by the
mountains of Loch Lomond.&nbsp; The suburbs of Glasgow extend
very far, houses on each side of the highway,&mdash;all ugly, and
the inhabitants dirty.&nbsp; The roads are very wide; and
everything seems to tell of the neighbourhood of a large
town.&nbsp; We were annoyed by carts and dirt, and the road was
full of people, who all noticed our car in one way or other; the
children often sent a hooting after us.</p>
<p>Wearied completely, we at last reached the town, and were glad
to walk, leading the car to the first decent inn, which was
luckily not far from the end of the town.&nbsp; William, who
gained most of his road-knowledge from ostlers, had been informed
of this house by the ostler at Hamilton; it proved quiet and
tolerably cheap, a new building&mdash;the Saracen&rsquo;s
Head.&nbsp; I shall never forget how glad I was to be landed in a
little quiet back-parlour, for my head was beating with the noise
of carts which we had left, and the wearisomeness of the
disagreeable objects near the highway; but with my first pleasant
sensations also came the feeling that we were not in an English
inn&mdash;partly from its half-unfurnished appearance, which is
common in Scotland, for in general the deal wainscots and doors
are unpainted, and partly from the dirtiness of the floors.&nbsp;
Having dined, William and I walked to the post-office, and after
much seeking found out a quiet timber-yard wherein to sit down
and read our letter.&nbsp; We then walked a considerable time in
the streets, which are perhaps as handsome as streets can be,
which derive no particular effect from <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>their
situation in connexion with natural advantages, such as rivers,
sea, or hills.&nbsp; The Trongate, an old street, is very
picturesque&mdash;high houses, with an intermixture of gable
fronts towards the street.&nbsp; The New Town is built of fine
stone, in the best style of the very best London streets at the
west end of the town, but, not being of brick, they are greatly
superior.&nbsp; One thing must strike every stranger in his first
walk through Glasgow&mdash;an appearance of business and bustle,
but no coaches or gentlemen&rsquo;s carriages; during all the
time we walked in the streets I only saw three carriages, and
these were travelling chaises.&nbsp; I also could not but observe
a want of cleanliness in the appearance of the lower orders of
the people, and a dulness in the dress and outside of the whole
mass, as they moved along.&nbsp; We returned to the inn before it
was dark.&nbsp; I had a bad headache, and was tired, and we all
went to bed soon.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>August</i> 23<i>d</i>.&mdash;A cold
morning.&nbsp; Walked to the bleaching-ground, <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> a large field bordering on the Clyde,
the banks of which are perfectly flat, and the general face of
the country is nearly so in the neighbourhood of Glasgow.&nbsp;
This field, the whole summer through, is covered with women of
all ages, children, and young girls spreading out their linen,
and watching it while it bleaches.&nbsp; The scene must be very
cheerful on a fine day, but it rained when we were there, and
though there was linen spread out in all parts, and great numbers
of women and girls were at work, yet there would have been many
more on a fine day, and they would have appeared happy, instead
of stupid and cheerless.&nbsp; In the middle of the field is a
wash-house, whither the <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>inhabitants of this large town, rich
and poor, send or carry their linen to be washed.&nbsp; There are
two very large rooms, with each a cistern in the middle for hot
water; and all round the rooms are benches for the women to set
their tubs upon.&nbsp; Both the rooms were crowded with washers;
there might be a hundred, or two, or even three; for it is not
easy to form an accurate notion of so great a number; however,
the rooms were large, and they were both full.&nbsp; It was
amusing to see so many women, arms, head, and face all in motion,
all busy in an ordinary household employment, in which we are
accustomed to see, at the most, only three or four women employed
in one place.&nbsp; The women were very civil.&nbsp; I learnt
from them the regulations of the house; but I have forgotten the
particulars.&nbsp; The substance of them is, that &lsquo;so
much&rsquo; is to be paid for each tub of water, &lsquo;so
much&rsquo; for a tub, and the privilege of washing for a day,
and, &lsquo;so much&rsquo; to the general overlookers of the
linen, when it is left to be bleached.&nbsp; An old man and woman
have this office, who were walking about, two melancholy
figures.</p>
<p>The shops at Glasgow are large, and like London shops, and we
passed by the largest coffee-room I ever saw.&nbsp; You look
across the piazza of the Exchange, and see to the end of the
coffee-room, where there is a circular window, the width of the
room.&nbsp; Perhaps there might be thirty gentlemen sitting on
the circular bench of the window, each reading a newspaper.&nbsp;
They had the appearance of figures in a fantoccine, or men seen
at the extremity of the opera-house, diminished into puppets.</p>
<p>I am sorry I did not see the High Church: both William and I
were tired, and it rained very hard after we had left the
bleaching-ground; besides, I am less eager to walk in a <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>large
town than anywhere else; so we put it off, and I have since
repented of my irresolution.</p>
<p>Dined, and left Glasgow at about three o&rsquo;clock, in a
heavy rain.&nbsp; We were obliged to ride through the streets to
keep our feet dry, and, in spite of the rain, every person as we
went along stayed his steps to look at us; indeed, we had the
pleasure of spreading smiles from one end of Glasgow to the
other&mdash;for we travelled the whole length of the town.&nbsp;
A set of schoolboys, perhaps there might he eight, with satchels
over their shoulders, and, except one or two, without shoes and
stockings, yet very well dressed in jackets and trousers, like
gentlemen&rsquo;s children, followed us in great delight,
admiring the car and longing to jump up.&nbsp; At last, though we
were seated, they made several attempts to get on behind; and
they looked so pretty and wild, and at the same time so modest,
that we wished to give them a ride, and there being a little hill
near the end of the town, we got off, and four of them who still
remained, the rest having dropped into their homes by the way,
took our places; and indeed I would have walked two miles
willingly, to have had the pleasure of seeing them so
happy.&nbsp; When they were to ride no longer, they scampered
away, laughing and rejoicing.&nbsp; New houses are rising up in
great numbers round Glasgow, citizen-like houses, and new
plantations, chiefly of fir; the fields are frequently enclosed
by hedgerows, but there is no richness, nor any particular beauty
for some miles.</p>
<p>The first object that interested us was a gentleman&rsquo;s
house upon a green plain or holm, almost close to the Clyde,
sheltered by tall trees, a quiet modest mansion, and, though
white-washed, being an old building, and no other house near it,
or in connexion with it, and standing upon the <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>level field,
which belonged to it, its own domain, the whole scene together
brought to our minds an image of the retiredness and sober
elegance of a nunnery; but this might be owing to the greyness of
the afternoon, and our having come immediately from Glasgow, and
through a country which, till now, had either had a townish
taint, or at best little of rural beauty.&nbsp; While we were
looking at the house we overtook a foot-traveller, who, like many
others, began to talk about our car.&nbsp; We alighted to walk up
a hill, and, continuing the conversation, the man told us, with
something like a national pride, that it belonged to a Scotch
Lord, Lord Semple; he added, that a little further on we should
see a much finer prospect, as fine a one as ever we had seen in
our lives.&nbsp; Accordingly, when we came to the top of the
hill, it opened upon us most magnificently.&nbsp; We saw the
Clyde, now a stately sea-river, winding away mile after mile,
spotted with boats and ships, each side of the river hilly, the
right populous with single houses and villages&mdash;Dunglass
Castle upon a promontory, the whole view terminated by the rock
of Dumbarton, at five or six miles distance, which stands by
itself, without any hills near it, like a sea-rock.</p>
<p>We travelled for some time near the river, passing through
clusters of houses which seemed to owe their existence rather to
the wealth of the river than the land, for the banks were mostly
bare, and the soil appeared poor, even near the water.&nbsp; The
left side of the river was generally uninhabited and moorish, yet
there are some beautiful spots: for instance, a nobleman&rsquo;s
house, <a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a> where the fields and trees were rich,
and, in combination with the river, looked very lovely.&nbsp; As
we went along <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>William and I were reminded of the
views upon the Thames in Kent, which, though greatly superior in
richness and softness, are much inferior in grandeur.&nbsp; Not
far from Dumbarton, we passed under some rocky, copse-covered
hills, which were so like some of the hills near Grasmere that we
could have half believed they were the same.&nbsp; Arrived at
Dumbarton before it was dark, having pushed on briskly that we
might have start of a traveller at the inn, who was following us
as fast as he could in a gig.&nbsp; Every front room was full,
and we were afraid we should not have been admitted.&nbsp; They
put us into a little parlour, dirty, and smelling of liquors, the
table uncleaned, and not a chair in its place; we were glad,
however, of our sorry accommodations.</p>
<p>While tea was preparing we lolled at our ease, and though the
room-window overlooked the stable-yard, and at our entrance there
appeared to be nothing but gloom and unloveliness, yet while I
lay stretched upon the carriage cushions on three chairs, I
discovered a little side peep which was enough to set the mind at
work.&nbsp; It was no more than a smoky vessel lying at anchor,
with its bare masts, a clay hut and the shelving bank of the
river, with a green pasture above.&nbsp; Perhaps you will think
that there is not much in this, as I describe it: it is true; but
the effect produced by these simple objects, as they happened to
be combined, together with the gloom of the evening, was
exceedingly wild.&nbsp; Our room was parted by a slender
partition from a large dining-room, in which were a number of
officers and their wives, who, after the first hour, never ceased
singing, dancing, laughing, or loud talking.&nbsp; The ladies
sang some pretty songs, a great relief to us.&nbsp; We went early
to bed; but poor Coleridge could <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>not sleep for
the noise at the street door; he lay in the parlour below
stairs.&nbsp; It is no uncommon thing in the best inns of
Scotland to have shutting-up beds in the sitting-rooms.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>August</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;As soon as
breakfast was over, William and I walked towards the Castle, a
short mile from the town.&nbsp; We overtook two young men, who,
on our asking the road, offered to conduct us, though it might
seem it was not easy to miss our way, for the rock rises singly
by itself from the plain on which the town stands.&nbsp; The rock
of Dumbarton is very grand when you are close to it, but at a
little distance, under an ordinary sky, and in open day, it is
not grand, but curiously wild.&nbsp; The castle and
fortifications add little effect to the general view of the rock,
especially since the building of a modern house, which is
white-washed, and consequently jars, wherever it is seen, with
the natural character of the place.&nbsp; There is a path up to
the house, but it being low water we could walk round the rock,
which we resolved to do.&nbsp; On that side next the town green
grass grows to a considerable height up the rock, but wherever
the river borders upon it, it is naked stone.&nbsp; I never saw
rock in nobler masses, or more deeply stained by time and
weather; nor is this to be wondered at, for it is in the very eye
of sea-storms and land-storms, of mountain winds and water
winds.&nbsp; It is of all colours, but a rusty yellow
predominates.&nbsp; As we walked along, we could not but look up
continually, and the mass above being on every side so huge, it
appeared more wonderful than when we saw the whole together.</p>
<p>We sat down on one of the large stones which lie scattered
near the base of the rock, with sea-weed growing amongst <!--
page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>them.&nbsp; Above our heads the rock was perpendicular
for a considerable height, nay, as it seemed, to the very top,
and on the brink of the precipice a few sheep, two of them rams
with twisted horns, stood, as if on the look-out over the wide
country.&nbsp; At the same time we saw a sentinel in his red
coat, walking backwards and forwards between us and the sky, with
his firelock over his shoulder.&nbsp; The sheep, I suppose owing
to our being accustomed to see them in similar situations,
appeared to retain their real size, while, on the contrary, the
soldier seemed to be diminished by the distance till he almost
looked like a puppet moved with wires for the pleasure of
children, or an eight years&rsquo; old drummer in his stiff,
manly dress beside a company of grenadiers.&nbsp; I had never
before, perhaps, thought of sheep and men in soldiers&rsquo;
dresses at the same time, and here they were brought together in
a strange fantastic way.&nbsp; As will be easily conceived, the
fearlessness and stillness of those quiet creatures, on the brow
of the rock, pursuing their natural occupations, contrasted with
the restless and apparently unmeaning motions of the dwarf
soldier, added not a little to the general effect of this place,
which is that of wild singularity, and the whole was aided by a
blustering wind and a gloomy sky.&nbsp; Coleridge joined us, and
we went up to the top of the rock.</p>
<p>The road to a considerable height is through a narrow cleft,
in which a flight of steps is hewn; the steps nearly fill the
cleft, and on each side the rocks form a high and irregular wall;
it is almost like a long sloping cavern, only that it is roofed
by the sky.&nbsp; We came to the barracks; soldiers&rsquo; wives
were hanging out linen upon the rails, while the wind beat about
them furiously&mdash;there was nothing which it could set in
motion but the garments of the <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>women and the
linen upon the rails; the grass&mdash;for we had now come to
green grass&mdash;was close and smooth, and not one pile an inch
above another, and neither tree nor shrub.&nbsp; The standard
pole stood erect without a flag.&nbsp; The rock has two summits,
one much broader and higher than the other.&nbsp; When we were
near to the top of the lower eminence we had the pleasure of
finding a little garden of flowers and vegetables belonging to
the soldiers.&nbsp; There are three distinct and very noble
prospects&mdash;the first up the Clyde towards
Glasgow&mdash;Dunglass Castle, seen on its
promontory&mdash;boats, sloops, hills, and many buildings; the
second, down the river to the sea&mdash;Greenock and
Port-Glasgow, and the distant mountains at the entrance of Loch
Long; and the third extensive and distant view is up the Leven,
which here falls into the Clyde, to the mountains of Loch
Lomond.&nbsp; The distant mountains in all these views were
obscured by mists and dingy clouds, but if the grand outline of
any one of the views can be seen, it is sufficient recompense for
the trouble of climbing the rock of Dumbarton.</p>
<p>The soldier who was our guide told us that an old ruin which
we came to at the top of the higher eminence had been a
wind-mill&mdash;an inconvenient station, though certainly a
glorious place for wind; perhaps if it really had been a
wind-mill it was only for the use of the garrison.&nbsp; We
looked over cannons on the battery-walls, and saw in an open
field below the yeomanry cavalry exercising, while we could hear
from the town, which was full of soldiers,
&lsquo;Dumbarton&rsquo;s drums beat bonny, O!&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet
while we stood upon this eminence, rising up so far as it
does&mdash;inland, and having the habitual old English feeling of
our own security as islanders&mdash;we could not help looking
upon the fortress, <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>in spite of its cannon and soldiers,
and the rumours of invasion, as set up against the hostilities of
wind and weather rather than for any other warfare.&nbsp; On our
return we were invited into the guard-room, about half-way down
the rock, where we were shown a large rusty sword, which they
called Wallace&rsquo;s Sword, and a trout boxed up in a well
close by, where they said he had been confined for upwards of
thirty years.&nbsp; For the pleasure of the soldiers, who were
anxious that we should see him, we took some pains to spy him out
in his black den, and at last succeeded.&nbsp; It was pleasing to
observe how much interest the poor soldiers&mdash;though
themselves probably new to the place&mdash;seemed to attach to
this antiquated inhabitant of their garrison.</p>
<p>When we had reached the bottom of the rock along the same road
by which we had ascended, we made our way over the rough stones
left bare by the tide, round the bottom of the rock, to the point
where we had set off.&nbsp; This is a wild and melancholy walk on
a blustering cloudy day: the naked bed of the river, scattered
over with sea-weed; grey swampy fields on the other shore;
sea-birds flying overhead; the high rock perpendicular and
bare.&nbsp; We came to two very large fragments, which had fallen
from the main rock; Coleridge thought that one of them was as
large as Bowder-Stone, <a name="citation61"></a><a
href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a> William and I did
not; but it is impossible to judge accurately; we probably,
without knowing it, compared them with the whole mass from which
they had fallen, which, from its situation, we consider as one
rock or stone, and there is no object of the kind for comparison
with the Bowder-Stone.&nbsp; When we leave the shore <!-- page
62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>of
the Clyde grass begins to show itself on the rock; go a
considerable way&mdash;still under the rock&mdash;along a flat
field, and pass immediately below the white house, which wherever
seen looks so ugly.</p>
<p>Left Dumbarton at about eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The sky
was cheerless and the air ungenial, which we regretted, as we
were going to Loch Lomond, and wished to greet the first of the
Scottish lakes with our cheerfullest and best feelings.&nbsp;
Crossed the Leven at the end of Dumbarton, and, when we looked
behind, had a pleasing view of the town, bridge, and rock; but
when we took in a reach of the river at the distance of perhaps
half a mile, the swamp ground, being so near a town, and not in
its natural wildness, but seemingly half cultivated, with houses
here and there, gave us an idea of extreme poverty of soil, or
that the inhabitants were either indolent or miserable.&nbsp; We
had to travel four miles on the banks of the &lsquo;Water of
Leven&rsquo; before we should come to Loch Lomond.&nbsp; Having
expected a grand river from so grand a lake, we were
disappointed; for it appeared to me not to be very much larger
than the Emont, and is not near so beautiful; but we must not
forget that the day was cold and gloomy.&nbsp; Near Dumbarton it
is like a river in a flat country, or under the influence of
tides; but a little higher up it resembles one of our rivers,
flowing through a vale of no extreme beauty, though prettily
wooded; the hills on each side not very high, sloping backwards
from the bed of the vale, which is neither very narrow nor very
wide; the prospect terminated by Ben Lomond and other
mountains.&nbsp; The vale is populous, but looks as if it were
not inhabited by cultivators of the earth; the houses are chiefly
of stone; often in rows by the river-side; they stand pleasantly,
but have a tradish look, as if they might <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>have been
off-sets from Glasgow.&nbsp; We saw many bleach-yards, but no
other symptom of a manufactory, except something in the houses
that was not rural, and a want of independent comforts.&nbsp;
Perhaps if the river had been glittering in the sun, and the
smoke of the cottages rising in distinct volumes towards the sky,
as I have seen in the vale or basin below Pillsden in
Dorsetshire, when every cottage, hidden from the eye, pointed out
its lurking-place by an upright wreath of white smoke, the whole
scene might have excited ideas of perfect cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Here, as on the Nith, and much more than in the Trough of the
Clyde, a great portion of the ground was uncultivated, but the
hills being less wild, the river more stately, and the ground not
heaved up so irregularly and tossed about, the imperfect
cultivation was the more to be lamented, particularly as there
were so many houses near the river.&nbsp; In a small enclosure by
the wayside is a pillar erected to the memory of Dr. Smollett,
who was born in a village at a little distance, which we could
see at the same time, and where, I believe, some of the family
still reside.&nbsp; There is a long Latin inscription, which
Coleridge translated for my benefit.&nbsp; The Latin is miserably
bad <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a>&mdash;as Coleridge said, such as poor
Smollett, who was an excellent scholar, would have been ashamed
of.</p>
<p>Before we came to Loch Lomond the vale widened, and became
less populous.&nbsp; We climbed over a wall into a large field to
have a better front view of the lake than from the road.&nbsp;
This view is very much like that from Mr. Clarkson&rsquo;s
windows: the mountain in front resembles Hallan; <!-- page
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>indeed, is almost the same; but Ben Lomond is not seen
standing in such majestic company as Helvellyn, and the meadows
are less beautiful than Ulswater.&nbsp; The reach of the lake is
very magnificent; you see it, as Ulswater is seen beyond the
promontory of Old Church, winding away behind a large woody
island that looks like a promontory.&nbsp; The outlet of the
lake&mdash;we had a distinct view of it in the field&mdash;is
very insignificant.&nbsp; The bulk of the river is frittered away
by small alder bushes, as I recollect; I do not remember that it
was reedy, but the ground had a swampy appearance; and here the
vale spreads out wide and shapeless, as if the river were born to
no inheritance, had no sheltering cradle, no hills of its
own.&nbsp; As we have seen, this does not continue long; it flows
through a distinct, though not a magnificent vale.&nbsp; But,
having lost the pastoral character which it had in the youthful
days of Smollett&mdash;if the description in his ode to his
native stream be a faithful one&mdash;it is less interesting than
it was then.</p>
<p>The road carried us sometimes close to the lake, sometimes at
a considerable distance from it, over moorish grounds, or through
half-cultivated enclosures; we had the lake on our right, which
is here so wide that the opposite hills, not being high, are cast
into insignificance, and we could not distinguish any buildings
near the water, if any there were.&nbsp; It is however always
delightful to travel by a lake of clear waters, if you see
nothing else but a very ordinary country; but we had some
beautiful distant views, one in particular, down the high road,
through a vista of over-arching trees; and the near shore was
frequently very pleasing, with its gravel banks, bendings, and
small bays.&nbsp; In one part it was bordered for a considerable
way by irregular groups of forest trees or single stragglers,
which, <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>although not large, seemed old; their
branches were stunted and knotty, as if they had been striving
with storms, and had half yielded to them.&nbsp; Under these
trees we had a variety of pleasing views across the lake, and the
very rolling over the road and looking at its smooth and
beautiful surface was itself a pleasure.&nbsp; It was as smooth
as a gravel walk, and of the bluish colour of some of the roads
among the lakes of the north of England.</p>
<p>Passed no very remarkable place till we came to Sir James
Colquhoun&rsquo;s house, which stands upon a large, flat, woody
peninsula, looking towards Ben Lomond.&nbsp; There must be many
beautiful walks among the copses of the peninsula, and delicious
views over the water; but the general surface of the country is
poor, and looks as if it ought to be rich and well peopled, for
it is not mountainous; nor had we passed any hills which a
Cumbrian would dignify with the name of mountains.&nbsp; There
was many a little plain or gently-sloping hill covered with poor
heath or broom without trees, where one should have liked to see
a cottage in a bower of wood, with its patch of corn and
potatoes, and a green field with a hedge to keep it warm.&nbsp;
As we advanced we perceived less of the coldness of poverty, the
hills not having so large a space between them and the
lake.&nbsp; The surface of the hills being in its natural state,
is always beautiful; but where there is only a half cultivated
and half peopled soil near the banks of a lake or river, the idea
is forced upon one that they who do live there have not much of
cheerful enjoyment.</p>
<p>But soon we came to just such a place as we had wanted to
see.&nbsp; The road was close to the water, and a hill, bare,
rocky, or with scattered copses rose above it.&nbsp; A deep shade
hung over the road, where some little boys were at play; <!--
page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>we expected a dwelling-house of some sort; and when we
came nearer, saw three or four thatched huts under the trees, and
at the same moment felt that it was a paradise.&nbsp; We had
before seen the lake only as one wide plain of water; but here
the portion of it which we saw was bounded by a high and steep,
heathy and woody island opposite, which did not appear like an
island, but the main shore, and framed out a little oblong lake
apparently not so broad as Rydale-water, with one small island
covered with trees, resembling some of the most beautiful of the
holms of Windermere, and only a narrow river&rsquo;s breadth from
the shore.&nbsp; This was a place where we should have liked to
have lived, and the only one we had seen near Loch Lomond.&nbsp;
How delightful to have a little shed concealed under the branches
of the fairy island! the cottages and the island might have been
made for the pleasure of each other.&nbsp; It was but like a
natural garden, the distance was so small; nay, one could not
have forgiven any one living there, not compelled to daily
labour, if he did not connect it with his dwelling by some
feeling of domestic attachment, like what he has for the orchard
where his children play.&nbsp; I thought, what a place for
William! he might row himself over with twenty strokes of the
oars, escaping from the business of the house, and as safe from
intruders, with his boat anchored beside him, as if he had locked
himself up in the strong tower of a castle.&nbsp; We were
unwilling to leave this sweet spot; but it was so simple, and
therefore so rememberable, that it seemed almost as if we could
have carried it away with us.&nbsp; It was nothing more than a
small lake enclosed by trees at the ends and by the way-side, and
opposite by the island, a steep bank on which the purple heath
was seen under low oak coppice-wood, a group of houses <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>over-shadowed by trees, and a bending road.&nbsp; There
was one remarkable tree, an old larch with hairy branches, which
sent out its main stem horizontally across the road, an object
that seemed to have been singled out for injury where everything
else was lovely and thriving, tortured into that shape by storms,
which one might have thought could not have reached it in that
sheltered place.</p>
<p>We were now entering into the Highlands.&nbsp; I believe Luss
is the place where we were told that country begins; but at these
cottages I would have gladly believed that we were there, for it
was like a new region.&nbsp; The huts were after the Highland
fashion, and the boys who were playing wore the Highland dress
and philabeg.&nbsp; On going into a new country I seem to myself
to waken up, and afterwards it surprises me to remember how much
alive I have been to the distinctions of dress, household
arrangements, etc. etc., and what a spirit these little things
give to wild, barren, or ordinary places.&nbsp; The cottages are
within about two miles of Luss.&nbsp; Came in view of several
islands; but the lake being so very wide, we could see little of
their peculiar beauties, and they, being large, hardly looked
like islands.</p>
<p>Passed another gentleman&rsquo;s house, which stands prettily
in a bay, <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> and soon after reached Luss, where we
intended to lodge.&nbsp; On seeing the outside of the inn, we
were glad that we were to have such pleasant quarters.&nbsp; It
is a nice-looking white house, by the road-side; but there was
not much promise of hospitality when we stopped at the door: no
person came out till we had shouted a considerable time.&nbsp; A
barefooted lass showed me up-stairs, and again my hopes revived;
the house was clean for a Scotch inn, and the view very pleasant
to the lake, over the top of the village&mdash;<!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>a cluster of
thatched houses among trees, with a large chapel in the midst of
them.&nbsp; Like most of the Scotch kirks which we had seen, this
building resembles a big house; but it is a much more pleasing
building than they generally are, and has one of our rustic
belfries, not unlike that at Ambleside, with two bells hanging in
the open air. <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a>&nbsp; We chose one of the back rooms to
sit in, being more snug, and they looked upon a very sweet
prospect&mdash;a stream tumbling down a cleft or glen on the
hill-side, rocky coppice ground, a rural lane, such as we have
from house to house at Grasmere, and a few outhouses.&nbsp; We
had a poor dinner, and sour ale; but as long as the people were
civil we were contented.</p>
<p>Coleridge was not well, so he did not stir out, but William
and I walked through the village to the shore of the lake.&nbsp;
When I came close to the houses, I could not but regret a want of
loveliness correspondent with the beauty of the situation and the
appearance of the village at a little distance; not a single
ornamented garden.&nbsp; We saw potatoes and cabbages, but never
a honeysuckle.&nbsp; Yet there were wild gardens, as beautiful as
any that ever man cultivated, overgrowing the roofs of some of
the cottages, flowers and creeping plants.&nbsp; How elegant were
the wreaths of the bramble that had &lsquo;built its own
bower&rsquo; upon the riggins in several parts of the village;
therefore we had chiefly to regret the want of gardens, as they
are symptoms of leisure and comfort, or at least of no painful
industry.&nbsp; Here we first saw houses without windows, the
smoke coming out of the open window-places; the chimneys were
like stools with four legs, a hole being left in the roof for the
smoke, and over that a slate placed upon four
sticks&mdash;sometimes the whole leaned as if it were going to
fall.&nbsp; The fields close to Luss lie flat to the lake, and a
<!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>river, as large as our stream near the church at
Grasmere, flows by the end of the village, being the same which
comes down the glen behind the inn; it is very much like our
stream&mdash;beds of blue pebbles upon the shores.</p>
<p>We walked towards the head of the lake, and from a large
pasture field near Luss, a gentle eminence, had a very
interesting view back upon the village and the lake and islands
beyond.&nbsp; We then perceived that Luss stood in the centre of
a spacious bay, and that close to it lay another small one,
within the larger, where the boats of the inhabitants were lying
at anchor, a beautiful natural harbour.&nbsp; The islands, as we
look down the water, are seen in great beauty.&nbsp;
Inch-ta-vanach, the same that framed out the little peaceful lake
which we had passed in the morning, towers above the rest.&nbsp;
The lake is very wide here, and the opposite shores not being
lofty the chief part of the permanent beauty of this view is
among the islands, and on the near shore, including the low
promontories of the bay of Luss, and the village; and we saw it
under its dullest aspect&mdash;the air cold, the sky gloomy,
without a glimpse of sunshine.</p>
<p>On a splendid evening, with the light of the sun diffused over
the whole islands, distant hills, and the broad expanse of the
lake, with its creeks, bays, and little slips of water among the
islands, it must be a glorious sight.</p>
<p>Up the lake there are no islands; Ben Lomond terminates the
view, without any other large mountains; no clouds were upon it,
therefore we saw the whole size and form of the mountain, yet it
did not appear to me so large as Skiddaw does from
Derwent-water.&nbsp; Continued our walk a considerable way
towards the head of the lake, and went up a high hill, but saw no
other reach of the <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>water.&nbsp; The hills on the Luss
side become much steeper, and the lake, having narrowed a little
above Luss, was no longer a very wide lake where we lost sight of
it.</p>
<p>Came to a bark hut by the shores, and sate for some time under
the shelter of it.&nbsp; While we were here a poor woman with a
little child by her side begged a penny of me, and asked where
she could &lsquo;find quarters in the village.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
was a travelling beggar, a native of Scotland, had often
&lsquo;heard of that water,&rsquo; but was never there
before.&nbsp; This woman&rsquo;s appearance, while the wind was
rustling about us, and the waves breaking at our feet, was very
melancholy: the waters looked wide, the hills many, and dark, and
far off&mdash;no house but at Luss.&nbsp; I thought what a dreary
waste must this lake be to such poor creatures, struggling with
fatigue and poverty and unknown ways!</p>
<p>We ordered tea when we reached the inn, and desired the girl
to light us a fire; she replied, &lsquo;I dinna ken whether
she&rsquo;ll gie fire,&rsquo; meaning her mistress.&nbsp; We told
her we did not wish her mistress to give fire, we only desired
her to let her make it and we would pay for it.&nbsp; The girl
brought in the tea-things, but no fire, and when I asked if she
was coming to light it, she said &lsquo;her mistress was not
varra willing to gie fire.&rsquo;&nbsp; At last, however, on our
insisting upon it, the fire was lighted: we got tea by
candlelight, and spent a comfortable evening.&nbsp; I had seen
the landlady before we went out, for, as had been usual in all
the country inns, there was a demur respecting beds,
notwithstanding the house was empty, and there were at least
half-a-dozen spare beds.&nbsp; Her countenance corresponded with
the unkindness of denying us a fire on a cold night, <a
name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a> for she was the most cruel and
hateful-looking woman I <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>ever saw.&nbsp; She was overgrown
with fat, and was sitting with her feet and legs in a tub of
water for the dropsy,&mdash;probably brought on by
whisky-drinking.&nbsp; The sympathy which I felt and expressed
for her, on seeing her in this wretched condition&mdash;for her
legs were swollen as thick as mill-posts&mdash;seemed to produce
no effect; and I was obliged, after five minutes&rsquo;
conversation, to leave the affair of the beds undecided.&nbsp;
Coleridge had some talk with her daughter, a smart lass in a
cotton gown, with a bandeau round her head, without shoes and
stockings.&nbsp; She told Coleridge with some pride that she had
not spent all her time at Luss, but was then fresh from
Glasgow.</p>
<p>It came on a very stormy night; the wind rattled every window
in the house, and it rained heavily.&nbsp; William and Coleridge
had bad beds, in a two-bedded room in the garrets, though there
were empty rooms on the first floor, and they were disturbed by a
drunken man, who had come to the inn when we were gone to
sleep.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>August</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;We were glad
when we awoke to see that it was a fine morning&mdash;the sky was
bright blue, with quick-moving clouds, the hills cheerful, lights
and shadows vivid and distinct.&nbsp; The village looked
exceedingly beautiful this morning from the garret
windows&mdash;the stream glittering near it, while it flowed
under trees through the level fields to the lake.&nbsp; After
breakfast, William and I went down to the water-side.&nbsp; The
roads were as dry as if no drop of rain had fallen, which added
to the pure cheerfulness of the appearance of the village, and
even of the distant prospect, an effect which I always seem to
perceive from clearly bright roads, for they are always
brightened by rain, after a storm; but when we <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>came among
the houses I regretted even more than last night, because the
contrast was greater, the slovenliness and dirt near the doors;
and could not but remember, with pain from the contrast, the
cottages of Somersetshire, covered with roses and myrtle, and
their small gardens of herbs and flowers.&nbsp; While lingering
by the shore we began to talk with a man who offered to row us to
Inch-ta-vanach; but the sky began to darken; and the wind being
high, we doubted whether we should venture, therefore made no
engagement; he offered to sell me some thread, pointing to his
cottage, and added that many English ladies carried thread away
from Luss.</p>
<p>Presently after Coleridge joined us, and we determined to go
to the island.&nbsp; I was sorry that the man who had been
talking with us was not our boatman; William by some chance had
engaged another.&nbsp; We had two rowers and a strong boat; so I
felt myself bold, though there was a great chance of a high
wind.&nbsp; The nearest point of Inch-ta-vanach is not perhaps
more than a mile and a quarter from Luss; we did not land there,
but rowed round the end, and landed on that side which looks
towards our favourite cottages, and their own island, which,
wherever seen, is still their own.&nbsp; It rained a little when
we landed, and I took my cloak, which afterwards served us to sit
down upon in our road up the hill, when the day grew much finer,
with gleams of sunshine.&nbsp; This island belongs to Sir James
Colquhoun, who has made a convenient road, that winds gently to
the top of it.</p>
<p>We had not climbed far before we were stopped by a sudden
burst of prospect, so singular and beautiful that it was like a
flash of images from another world.&nbsp; We stood with our backs
to the hill of the island, which we <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>were
ascending, and which shut out Ben Lomond entirely, and all the
upper part of the lake, and we looked towards the foot of the
lake, scattered over with islands without beginning and without
end.&nbsp; The sun shone, and the distant hills were visible,
some through sunny mists, others in gloom with patches of
sunshine; the lake was lost under the low and distant hills, and
the islands lost in the lake, which was all in motion with
travelling fields of light, or dark shadows under rainy
clouds.&nbsp; There are many hills, but no commanding eminence at
a distance to confine the prospect, so that the land seemed
endless as the water.</p>
<p>What I had heard of Loch Lomond, or any other place in Great
Britain, had given me no idea of anything like what we beheld: it
was an outlandish scene&mdash;we might have believed ourselves in
North America.&nbsp; The islands were of every possible variety
of shape and surface&mdash;hilly and level, large and small,
bare, rocky, pastoral, or covered with wood.&nbsp; Immediately
under my eyes lay one large flat island, bare and green, so flat
and low that it scarcely appeared to rise above the water, with
straggling peat-stacks and a single hut upon one of its
out-shooting promontories&mdash;for it was of a very irregular
shape, though perfectly flat.&nbsp; Another, its next neighbour,
and still nearer to us, was covered over with heath and
coppice-wood, the surface undulating, with flat or sloping banks
towards the water, and hollow places, cradle-like valleys,
behind.&nbsp; These two islands, with Inch-ta-vanach, where we
were standing, were intermingled with the water, I might say
interbedded and interveined with it, in a manner that was
exquisitely pleasing.&nbsp; There were bays innumerable, straits
or passages like calm rivers, landlocked lakes, and, to the main
water, stormy promontories.&nbsp; The solitary hut on the flat
green island seemed unsheltered <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>and desolate,
and yet not wholly so, for it was but a broad river&rsquo;s
breadth from the covert of the wood of the other island.&nbsp;
Near to these is a miniature, an islet covered with trees, on
which stands a small ruin that looks like the remains of a
religious house; it is overgrown with ivy, and were it not that
the arch of a window or gateway may be distinctly seen, it would
be difficult to believe that it was not a tuft of trees growing
in the shape of a ruin, rather than a ruin overshadowed by
trees.&nbsp; When we had walked a little further we saw below us,
on the nearest large island, where some of the wood had been cut
down, a hut, which we conjectured to be a bark hut.&nbsp; It
appeared to be on the shore of a little forest lake, enclosed by
Inch-ta-vanach, where we were, and the woody island on which the
hut stands.</p>
<p>Beyond we had the same intricate view as before, and could
discover Dumbarton rock with its double head.&nbsp; There being a
mist over it, it had a ghost-like appearance&mdash;as I observed
to William and Coleridge, something like the Tor of Glastonbury
from the Dorsetshire hills.&nbsp; Right before us, on the flat
island mentioned before, were several small single trees or
shrubs, growing at different distances from each other, close to
the shore, but some optical delusion had detached them from the
land on which they stood, and they had the appearance of so many
little vessels sailing along the coast of it.&nbsp; I mention the
circumstance, because, with the ghostly image of Dumbarton
Castle, and the ambiguous ruin on the small island, it was much
in the character of the scene, which was throughout magical and
enchanting&mdash;a new world in its great permanent outline and
composition, and changing at every moment in every part of it by
the effect of sun and wind, and mist and <!-- page 75--><a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>shower and
cloud, and the blending lights and deep shades which took place
of each other, traversing the lake in every direction.&nbsp; The
whole was indeed a strange mixture of soothing and restless
images, of images inviting to rest, and others hurrying the fancy
away into an activity still more pleasing than repose.&nbsp; Yet,
intricate and homeless, that is, without lasting abiding-place
for the mind, as the prospect was, there was no perplexity; we
had still a guide to lead us forward.</p>
<p>Wherever we looked, it was a delightful feeling that there was
something beyond.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the sense of quiet was never
lost sight of; the little peaceful lakes among the islands might
make you forget that the great water, Loch Lomond, was so near;
and yet are more beautiful, because you know that it is so: they
have their own bays and creeks sheltered within a shelter.&nbsp;
When we had ascended to the top of the island we had a view up to
Ben Lomond, over the long, broad water without spot or rock; and,
looking backwards, saw the islands below us as on a map.&nbsp;
This view, as may be supposed, was not nearly so interesting as
those we had seen before.&nbsp; We hunted out all the houses on
the shore, which were very few: there was the village of Luss,
the two gentlemen&rsquo;s houses, our favourite cottages, and
here and there a hut; but I do not recollect any
comfortable-looking farm-houses, and on the opposite shore not a
single dwelling.&nbsp; The whole scene was a combination of
natural wildness, loveliness, beauty, and barrenness, or rather
bareness, yet not comfortless or cold; but the whole was
beautiful.&nbsp; We were too far off the more distant shore to
distinguish any particular spots which we might have regretted
were not better cultivated, and near Luss there was no want of
houses.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>After we had left the island, having been so much taken
with the beauty of the bark hut and the little lake by which it
appeared to stand, we desired the boatman to row us through it,
and we landed at the hut.&nbsp; Walked upon the island for some
time, and found out sheltered places for cottages.&nbsp; There
were several woodman&rsquo;s huts, which, with some scattered
fir-trees, and others in irregular knots, that made a delicious
murmuring in the wind, added greatly to the romantic effect of
the scene.&nbsp; They were built in the form of a cone from the
ground, like savages&rsquo; huts, the door being just large
enough for a man to enter with stooping.&nbsp; Straw beds were
raised on logs of wood, tools lying about, and a forked bough of
a tree was generally suspended from the roof in the middle to
hang a kettle upon.&nbsp; It was a place that might have been
just visited by new settlers.&nbsp; I thought of Ruth and her
dreams of romantic love:</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And then he said how sweet it were,<br
/>
A fisher or a hunter there,<br />
A gardener in the shade,<br />
Still wandering with an easy mind,<br />
To build a household fire, and find<br />
A home in every glade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We found the main lake very stormy when we had left the
shelter of the islands, and there was again a threatening of
rain, but it did not come on.&nbsp; I wanted much to go to the
old ruin, but the boatmen were in a hurry to be at home.&nbsp;
They told us it had been a stronghold built by a man who lived
there alone, and was used to swim over and make depredations on
the shore,&mdash;that nobody could ever lay hands on him, he was
such a good swimmer, but at last they caught him in a net.&nbsp;
The men pointed out to <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>us an island belonging to Sir James
Colquhoun, on which were a great quantity of deer.</p>
<p>Arrived at the inn at about twelve o&rsquo;clock, and prepared
to depart immediately: we should have gone with great regret if
the weather had been warmer and the inn more comfortable.&nbsp;
When we were leaving the door, a party with smart carriage and
servants drove up, and I observed that the people of the house
were just as slow in their attendance upon them as on us, with
one single horse and outlandish Hibernian vehicle.</p>
<p>When we had travelled about two miles the lake became
considerably narrower, the hills rocky, covered with copses, or
bare, rising more immediately from the bed of the water, and
therefore we had not so often to regret the want of
inhabitants.&nbsp; Passed by, or saw at a distance, sometimes a
single cottage, or two or three together, but the whole space
between Luss and Tarbet is a solitude to the eye.&nbsp; We were
reminded of Ulswater, but missed the pleasant farms, and the
mountains were not so interesting: we had not seen them in
companies or brotherhoods rising one above another at a long
distance.&nbsp; Ben Lomond stood alone, opposite to us,
majestically overlooking the lake; yet there was something in
this mountain which disappointed me,&mdash;a want of massiveness
and simplicity, perhaps from the top being broken into three
distinct stages.&nbsp; The road carried us over a bold promontory
by a steep and high ascent, and we had a long view of the lake
pushing itself up in a narrow line through an avenue of
mountains, terminated by the mountains at the head of the lake,
of which Ben Lui, if I do not mistake, is the most
considerable.&nbsp; The afternoon was showery and misty,
therefore we did not see this prospect so distinctly <!-- page
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>as we
could have wished, but there was a grand obscurity over it which
might make the mountains appear more numerous.</p>
<p>I have said so much of this lake that I am tired myself, and I
fear I must have tired my friends.&nbsp; We had a pleasant
journey to Tarbet; more than half of it on foot, for the road was
hilly, and after we had climbed one small hill we were not
desirous to get into the car again, seeing another before us, and
our path was always delightful, near the lake, and frequently
through woods.&nbsp; When we were within about half a mile of
Tarbet, at a sudden turning looking to the left, we saw a very
craggy-topped mountain amongst other smooth ones; the rocks on
the summit distinct in shape as if they were buildings raised up
by man, or uncouth images of some strange creature.&nbsp; We
called out with one voice, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what we
wanted!&rsquo; alluding to the frame-like uniformity of the
side-screens of the lake for the last five or six miles.&nbsp; As
we conjectured, this singular mountain was the famous Cobbler,
near Arrochar.&nbsp; Tarbet was before us in the recess of a
deep, large bay, under the shelter of a hill.&nbsp; When we came
up to the village we had to inquire for the inn, there being no
signboard.&nbsp; It was a well-sized white house, the best in the
place.&nbsp; We were conducted up-stairs into a sitting-room that
might make any good-humoured travellers happy&mdash;a square
room, with windows on each side, looking, one way, towards the
mountains, and across the lake to Ben Lomond, the other.</p>
<p>There was a pretty stone house before (<i>i.e.</i> towards the
lake) some huts, scattered trees, two or three green fields with
hedgerows, and a little brook making its way towards the lake;
the fields are almost flat, and screened on that <!-- page
79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>side
nearest the head of the lake by a hill, which, pushing itself
out, forms the bay of Tarbet, and, towards the foot, by a gentle
slope and trees.&nbsp; The lake is narrow, and Ben Lomond shuts
up the prospect, rising directly from the water.&nbsp; We could
have believed ourselves to be by the side of Ulswater, at
Glenridden, or in some other of the inhabited retirements of that
lake.&nbsp; We were in a sheltered place among mountains; it was
not an open joyous bay, with a cheerful populous village, like
Luss; but a pastoral and retired spot, with a few single
dwellings.&nbsp; The people of the inn stared at us when we
spoke, without giving us an answer immediately, which we were at
first disposed to attribute to coarseness of manners, but found
afterwards that they did not understand us at once, Erse being
the language spoken in the family.&nbsp; Nothing but salt meat
and eggs for dinner&mdash;no potatoes; the house smelt strongly
of herrings, which were hung to dry over the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>Walked in the evening towards the head of the lake; the road
was steep over the hill, and when we had reached the top of it we
had long views up and down the water.&nbsp; Passed a troop of
women who were resting themselves by the roadside, as if
returning from their day&rsquo;s labour.&nbsp; Amongst them was a
man, who had walked with us a considerable way in the morning,
and told us he was just come from America, where he had been for
some years,&mdash;was going to his own home, and should return to
America.&nbsp; He spoke of emigration as a glorious thing for
them who had money.&nbsp; Poor fellow! I do not think that he had
brought much back with him, for he had worked his passage over: I
much suspected that a bundle, which he carried upon a stick, tied
in a pocket-handkerchief, contained his all.&nbsp; He was almost
blind, he said, as were many of the <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>crew.&nbsp;
He intended crossing the lake at the ferry; but it was stormy,
and he thought he should not be able to get over that day.&nbsp;
I could not help smiling when I saw him lying by the roadside
with such a company about him, not like a wayfaring man, but
seeming as much at home and at his ease as if he had just stepped
out of his hut among them, and they had been neighbours all their
lives. <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a>&nbsp; Passed one pretty house, a large
thatched dwelling with out-houses, but the prospect above and
below was solitary.</p>
<p>The sun had long been set before we returned to the inn.&nbsp;
As travellers, we were glad to see the moon over the top of one
of the hills, but it was a cloudy night, without any peculiar
beauty or solemnity.&nbsp; After tea we made inquiries respecting
the best way to go to Loch Ketterine; the landlord could give but
little information, and nobody seemed to know anything distinctly
of the place, though it was but ten miles off.&nbsp; We applied
to the maid-servant who waited on us: she was a fine-looking
young woman, dressed in a white bed-gown, her hair fastened up by
a comb, and without shoes and stockings.&nbsp; When we asked her
about the Trossachs she could give us no information, but on our
saying, &lsquo;Do you know Loch Ketterine?&rsquo; she answered
with a smile, &lsquo;I <i>should</i> know that loch, for I was
bred and born there.&rsquo;&nbsp; After much difficulty we
learned from her that the Trossachs were at the foot of the lake,
and that by the way we were to go we should come upon them at the
head, should have to travel ten miles to the foot <a
name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a"
class="citation">[80a]</a> of the water, and that there was no
inn by the way.&nbsp; The girl spoke English very distinctly; but
she had few <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>words, and found it difficult to
understand us.&nbsp; She did not much encourage us to go, because
the roads were bad, and it was a long way, &lsquo;and there was
no putting-up for the like of us.&rsquo;&nbsp; We determined,
however, to venture, and throw ourselves upon the hospitality of
some cottager or gentleman.&nbsp; We desired the landlady to
roast us a couple of fowls to carry with us.&nbsp; There are
always plenty of fowls at the doors of a Scotch inn, and eggs are
as regularly brought to table at breakfast as bread and
butter.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>August</i> 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;We did not set
off till between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock, much too late for
a long day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; Our boatman lived at the pretty
white house which we saw from the windows: we called at his door
by the way, and, even when we were near the house, the outside
looked comfortable; but within I never saw anything so miserable
from dirt, and dirt alone: it reminded one of the house of a
decayed weaver in the suburbs of a large town, with a sickly wife
and a large family; but William says it was far worse, that it
was quite Hottentotish.</p>
<p>After long waiting, and many clumsy preparations, we got
ourselves seated in the boat; but we had not floated five yards
before we perceived that if any of the party&mdash;and there was
a little Highland woman who was going over the water with us, the
boatman, his helper, and ourselves&mdash;should stir but a few
inches, leaning to one side or the other, the boat would be full
in an instant, and we at the bottom; besides, it was very leaky,
and the woman was employed to lade out the water
continually.&nbsp; It appeared that this crazy vessel was not the
man&rsquo;s own, and that <i>his</i> was lying in a bay at a
little distance.&nbsp; He said he would <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>take us to it
as fast as possible, but I was so much frightened I would gladly
have given up the whole day&rsquo;s journey; indeed not one of us
would have attempted to cross the lake in that boat for a
thousand pounds.&nbsp; We reached the larger boat in safety after
coasting a considerable way near the shore, but just as we were
landing, William dropped the bundle which contained our food into
the water.&nbsp; The fowls were no worse, but some sugar, ground
coffee, and pepper-cake seemed to be entirely spoiled.&nbsp; We
gathered together as much of the coffee and sugar as we could and
tied it up, and again trusted ourselves to the lake.&nbsp; The
sun shone, and the air was calm&mdash;luckily it had been so
while we were in the crazy boat&mdash;we had rocks and woods on
each side of us, or bare hills; seldom a single cottage and there
was no rememberable place till we came opposite to a waterfall of
no inconsiderable size, that appeared to drop directly into the
lake: close to it was a hut, which we were told was the
ferry-house.&nbsp; On the other side of the lake was a pretty
farm under the mountains, beside a river, the cultivated grounds
lying all together, and sloping towards the lake from the
mountain hollow down which the river came.&nbsp; It is not easy
to conceive how beautiful these spots appeared after moving on so
long between the solitary steeps.</p>
<p>We went a considerable way further, and landed at Rob
Roy&rsquo;s Caves, which are in fact no caves, but some fine
rocks on the brink of the lake, in the crevices of which a man
might hide himself cunningly enough; the water is very deep below
them, and the hills above steep and covered with wood.&nbsp; The
little Highland woman, who was in size about a match for our
guide at Lanerk, accompanied us hither.&nbsp; There was something
very gracious in the <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>manners of this woman; she could
scarcely speak five English words, yet she gave me, whenever I
spoke to her, as many intelligible smiles as I had needed English
words to answer me, and helped me over the rocks in the most
obliging manner.&nbsp; She had left the boat out of good-will to
us, or for her own amusement.&nbsp; She had never seen these
caves before; but no doubt had heard of them, the tales of Rob
Roy&rsquo;s exploits being told familiarly round the
&lsquo;ingles&rsquo; hereabouts, for this neighbourhood was his
home.&nbsp; We landed at Inversneyde, the ferry-house by the
waterfall, and were not sorry to part with our boatman, who was a
coarse hard-featured man, and, speaking of the French, uttered
the basest and most cowardly sentiments.&nbsp; His helper, a
youth fresh from the Isle of Skye, was innocent of this fault,
and though but a bad rower, was a far better companion; he could
not speak a word of English, and sang a plaintive Gaelic air in a
low tone while he plied his oar.</p>
<p>The ferry-house stood on the bank a few yards above the
landing-place where the boat lies.&nbsp; It is a small hut under
a steep wood, and a few yards to the right, looking towards the
hut, is the waterfall.&nbsp; The fall is not very high, but the
stream is considerable, as we could see by the large black stones
that were lying bare, but the rains, if they had reached this
place, had had little effect upon the waterfall; its noise was
not so great as to form a contrast with the stillness of the bay
into which it falls, where the boat, and house, and waterfall
itself seemed all sheltered and protected.&nbsp; The Highland
woman was to go with us the two first miles of our journey.&nbsp;
She led us along a bye foot-path a shorter way up the hill from
the ferry-house.&nbsp; There is a considerable settling in the
hills that border Loch Lomond, at the passage by which we were to
cross to Loch Ketterine; <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Ben Lomond,
terminating near the ferry-house, is on the same side of the
water with it, and about three miles above Tarbet.</p>
<p>We had to climb right up the hill, which is very steep, and,
when close under it, seemed to be high, but we soon reached the
top, and when we were there had lost sight of the lake; and now
our road was over a moor, or rather through a wide moorland
hollow.&nbsp; Having gone a little way, we saw before us, at the
distance of about half a mile, a very large stone building, a
singular structure, with a high wall round it, naked hill above,
and neither field nor tree near; but the moor was not overgrown
with heath merely, but grey grass, such as cattle might pasture
upon.&nbsp; We could not conjecture what this building was; it
appeared as if it had been built strong to defend it from storms;
but for what purpose?&nbsp; William called out to us that we
should observe that place well, for it was exactly like one of
the spittals of the Alps, built for the reception of travellers,
and indeed I had thought it must be so before he spoke.&nbsp;
This building, from its singular structure and appearance, made
the place, which is itself in a country like Scotland nowise
remarkable, take a character of unusual wildness and
desolation&mdash;this when we first came in view of it; and
afterwards, when we had passed it and looked back, three
pyramidal mountains on the opposite side of Loch Lomond
terminated the view, which under certain accidents of weather
must be very grand.&nbsp; Our Highland companion had not English
enough to give us any information concerning this strange
building; we could only get from her that it was a &lsquo;large
house,&rsquo; which was plain enough.</p>
<p>We walked about a mile and a half over the moor without seeing
any other dwelling but one hut by the burn-side, <!-- page
85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>with
a peat-stack and a ten-yards&rsquo;-square enclosure for
potatoes; then we came to several clusters of houses, even
hamlets they might be called, but where there is any land
belonging to the Highland huts there are so many outbuildings
near, which differ in no respect from the dwelling-houses except
that they send out no smoke, that one house looks like two or
three.&nbsp; Near these houses was a considerable quantity of
cultivated ground, potatoes and corn, and the people were busy
making hay in the hollow places of the open vale, and all along
the sides of the becks.&nbsp; It was a pretty sight
altogether&mdash;men and women, dogs, the little running streams,
with linen bleaching near them, and cheerful sunny hills and
rocks on every side.&nbsp; We passed by one patch of potatoes
that a florist might have been proud of; no carnation-bed ever
looked more gay than this square plot of ground on the waste
common.&nbsp; The flowers were in very large bunches, and of an
extraordinary size, and of every conceivable shade of colouring
from snow-white to deep purple.&nbsp; It was pleasing in that
place, where perhaps was never yet a flower cultivated by man for
his own pleasure, to see these blossoms grow more gladly than
elsewhere, making a summer garden near the mountain
dwellings.</p>
<p>At one of the clusters of houses we parted with our companion,
who had insisted on bearing my bundle while she stayed with us: I
often tried to enter into conversation with her, and seeing a
small tarn before us, was reminded of the pleasure of fishing and
the manner of living there, and asked her what sort of food was
eaten in that place, if they lived much upon fish, or had mutton
from the hills; she looked earnestly at me, and shaking her head,
replied, &lsquo;Oh yes! eat fish&mdash;no papistes, eat
everything.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>The tarn had
one small island covered with wood; the stream that runs from it
falls into Loch Ketterine, which, after we had gone a little
beyond the tarn, we saw at some distance before us.</p>
<p>Pursued the road, a mountain horse-track, till we came to a
corner of what seemed the head of the lake, and there sate down
completely tired, and hopeless as to the rest of our
journey.&nbsp; The road ended at the shore, and no houses were to
be seen on the opposite side except a few widely parted huts, and
on the near side was a trackless heath.&nbsp; The land at the
head of the lake was but a continuation of the common we had come
along, and was covered with heather, intersected by a few
straggling foot-paths.</p>
<p>Coleridge and I were faint with hunger, and could go no
further till we had refreshed ourselves, so we ate up one of our
fowls, and drank of the water of Loch Ketterine; but William
could not be easy till he had examined the coast, so he left us,
and made his way along the moor across the head of the
lake.&nbsp; Coleridge and I, as we sate, had what seemed to us
but a dreary prospect&mdash;a waste of unknown ground which we
guessed we must travel over before it was possible for us to find
a shelter.&nbsp; We saw a long way down the lake; it was all moor
on the near side; on the other the hills were steep from the
water, and there were large coppice-woods, but no cheerful green
fields, and no road that we could see; we knew, however, that
there must be a road from house to house; but the whole lake
appeared a solitude&mdash;neither boats, islands, nor houses, no
grandeur in the hills, nor any loveliness in the shores.&nbsp;
When we first came in view of it we had said it was like a barren
Ulswater&mdash;Ulswater dismantled of its grandeur, and cropped
of its lesser beauties.&nbsp; When I had swallowed my dinner <!--
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>I hastened after William, and Coleridge followed
me.&nbsp; Walked through the heather with some labour for perhaps
half a mile, and found William sitting on the top of a small
eminence, whence we saw the real head of the lake, which was
pushed up into the vale a considerable way beyond the promontory
where we now sate.&nbsp; The view up the lake was very pleasing,
resembling Thirlemere below Armath.&nbsp; There were rocky
promontories and woody islands, and, what was most cheering to
us, a neat white house on the opposite shore; but we could see no
boats, so, in order to get to it we should be obliged to go round
the head of the lake, a long and weary way.</p>
<p>After Coleridge came up to us, while we were debating whether
we should turn back or go forward, we espied a man on horseback
at a little distance, with a boy following him on foot, no doubt
a welcome sight, and we hailed him.&nbsp; We should have been
glad to have seen either man, woman, or child at this time, but
there was something uncommon and interesting in this man&rsquo;s
appearance, which would have fixed our attention wherever we had
met him.&nbsp; He was a complete Highlander in dress, figure, and
face, and a very fine-looking man, hardy and vigorous, though
past his prime.&nbsp; While he stood waiting for us in his bonnet
and plaid, which never look more graceful than on horseback, I
forgot our errand, and only felt glad that we were in the
Highlands.&nbsp; William accosted him with, &lsquo;Sir, do you
speak English?&rsquo;&nbsp; He replied, &lsquo;A
little.&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke however, sufficiently well for our
purpose, and very distinctly, as all the Highlanders do who learn
English as a foreign language; but in a long conversation they
want words; he informed us that he himself was going beyond the
Trossachs, to Callander, that no boats were kept to
&lsquo;let;&rsquo; but there were <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>two
gentlemen&rsquo;s houses at this end of the lake, one of which we
could not yet see, it being hidden from us by a part of the hill
on which we stood.&nbsp; The other house was that which we saw
opposite to us; both the gentlemen kept boats, and probably might
be able to spare one of their servants to go with us.&nbsp; After
we had asked many questions, which the Highlander answered with
patience and courtesy, he parted from us, going along a sort of
horse-track, which a foot-passenger, if he once get into it, need
not lose if he be careful.</p>
<p>When he was gone we again debated whether we should go back to
Tarbet, or throw ourselves upon the mercy of one of the two
gentlemen for a night&rsquo;s lodging.&nbsp; What we had seen of
the main body of the lake made us little desire to see more of
it; the Highlander upon the naked heath, in his Highland dress,
upon his careful-going horse, with the boy following him, was
worth it all; but after a little while we resolved to go on,
ashamed to shrink from an adventure.&nbsp; Pursued the
horse-track, and soon came in sight of the other
gentleman&rsquo;s house, which stood on the opposite side of the
vale, a little above the lake.&nbsp; It was a white house; no
trees near it except a new plantation of firs; but the fields
were green, sprinkled over with haycocks, and the brook which
comes down the valley and falls into the lake ran through
them.&nbsp; It was like a new-made farm in a mountain vale, and
yet very pleasing after the depressing prospect which had been
before us.</p>
<p>Our road was rough, and not easy to be kept.&nbsp; It was
between five and six o&rsquo;clock when we reached the brook
side, where Coleridge and I stopped, and William went up towards
the house, which was in a field, where about half a dozen people
were at work.&nbsp; He addressed himself to one <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>who appeared
like the master, and all drew near him, staring at William as
nobody could have stared but out of sheer rudeness, except in
such a lonely place.&nbsp; He told his tale, and inquired about
boats; there were no boats, and no lodging nearer than Callander,
ten miles beyond the foot of the lake.&nbsp; A laugh was on every
face when William said we were come to see the Trossachs; no
doubt they thought we had better have stayed at our own
homes.&nbsp; William endeavoured to make it appear not so very
foolish, by informing them that it was a place much celebrated in
England, though perhaps little thought of by them, and that we
only differed from many of our countrymen in having come the
wrong way in consequence of an erroneous direction.</p>
<p>After a little time the gentleman said we should be
accommodated with such beds as they had, and should be welcome to
rest in their house if we pleased.&nbsp; William came back for
Coleridge and me; the men all stood at the door to receive us,
and now their behaviour was perfectly courteous.&nbsp; We were
conducted into the house by the same man who had directed us
hither on the other side of the lake, and afterwards we learned
that he was the father of our hostess.&nbsp; He showed us into a
room up-stairs, begged we would sit at our ease, walk out, or do
just as we pleased.&nbsp; It was a large square deal wainscoted
room, the wainscot black with age, yet had never been painted: it
did not look like an English room, and yet I do not know in what
it differed, except that in England it is not common to see so
large and well-built a room so ill-furnished: there were two or
three large tables, and a few old chairs of different sorts, as
if they had been picked up one did not know how, at sales, or had
belonged to different rooms of the house ever since it was
built.&nbsp; We sat perhaps <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>three-quarters of an hour, and I was about to carry down
our wet coffee and sugar and ask leave to boil it, when the
mistress of the house entered, a tall fine-looking woman, neatly
dressed in a dark-coloured gown, with a white handkerchief tied
round her head; she spoke to us in a very pleasing manner,
begging permission to make tea for us, an offer which we
thankfully accepted.&nbsp; Encouraged by the sweetness of her
manners, I went down-stairs to dry my feet by the kitchen fire;
she lent me a pair of stockings, and behaved to me with the
utmost attention and kindness.&nbsp; She carried the tea-things
into the room herself, leaving me to make tea, and set before us
cheese and butter and barley cakes.&nbsp; These cakes are as thin
as our oat-bread, but, instead of being crisp, are soft and
leathery, yet we, being hungry, and the butter delicious, ate
them with great pleasure, but when the same bread was set before
us afterwards we did not like it.</p>
<p>After tea William and I walked out; we amused ourselves with
watching the Highlanders at work: they went leisurely about
everything, and whatever was to be done, all followed, old men,
and young, and little children.&nbsp; We were driven into the
house by a shower, which came on with the evening darkness, and
the people leaving their work paused at the same time.&nbsp; I
was pleased to see them a while after sitting round a blazing
fire in the kitchen, father and son-in-law, master and man, and
the mother with her little child on her knee.&nbsp; When I had
been there before tea I had observed what a contrast there was
between the mistress and her kitchen; she did not differ in
appearance from an English country lady; but her kitchen, roof,
walls, and floor of mud, was all black alike; yet now, with the
light of a bright fire upon so <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>many happy
countenances, the whole room made a pretty sight.</p>
<p>We heard the company laughing and talking long after we were
in bed; indeed I believe they never work till they are
tired.&nbsp; The children could not speak a word of English: they
were very shy at first; but after I had caressed the eldest, and
given her a red leather purse, with which she was delighted, she
took hold of my hand and hung about me, changing her side-long
looks for pretty smiles.&nbsp; Her mother lamented they were so
far from school, they should be obliged to send the children down
into the Lowlands to be taught reading and English.&nbsp;
Callander, the nearest town, was twenty miles from them, and it
was only a small place: they had their groceries from
Glasgow.&nbsp; She said that at Callander was their nearest
church, but sometimes &lsquo;got a preaching at the
Garrison.&rsquo;&nbsp; In explaining herself she informed us that
the large building which had puzzled us in the morning had been
built by Government, at the request of one of the Dukes of
Montrose, for the defence of his domains against the attacks of
Rob Roy.&nbsp; I will not answer for the truth of this; perhaps
it might have been built for this purpose, and as a check on the
Highlands in general; certain it is, however, that it was a
garrison; soldiers used to be constantly stationed there, and
have only been withdrawn within the last thirteen or fourteen
years.&nbsp; Mrs. Macfarlane attended me to my room; she said she
hoped I should be able to sleep upon blankets, and said they were
&lsquo;fresh from the fauld.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>August</i> 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Before I
rose, Mrs. Macfarlane came into my room to see if I wanted
anything, and told me she should send the servant up with a basin
of whey, <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>saying, &lsquo;We make very good whey
in this country;&rsquo; indeed, I thought it the best I had ever
tasted; but I cannot tell how this should be, for they only make
skimmed-milk cheeses.&nbsp; I asked her for a little bread and
milk for our breakfast, but she said it would be no trouble to
make tea, as she must make it for the family; so we all
breakfasted together.&nbsp; The cheese was set out, as before,
with plenty of butter and barley-cakes, and fresh baked oaten
cakes, which, no doubt, were made for us: they had been kneaded
with cream, and were excellent.&nbsp; All the party pressed us to
eat, and were very jocose about the necessity of helping out
their coarse bread with butter, and they themselves ate almost as
much butter as bread.&nbsp; In talking of the French and the
present times, their language was what most people would call
Jacobinical.&nbsp; They spoke much of the oppressions endured by
the Highlanders further up, of the absolute impossibility of
their living in any comfort, and of the cruelty of laying so many
restraints on emigration.&nbsp; Then they spoke with animation of
the attachment of the clans to their lairds: &lsquo;The laird of
this place, Glengyle, where we live, could have commanded so many
men who would have followed him to the death; and now there are
none left.&rsquo;&nbsp; It appeared that Mr. Macfarlane, and his
wife&rsquo;s brother, Mr. Macalpine, farmed the place, inclusive
of the whole vale upwards to the mountains, and the mountains
themselves, under the lady of Glengyle, the mother of the young
laird, a minor.&nbsp; It was a sheep-farm.</p>
<p>Speaking of another neighbouring laird, they said he had gone,
like the rest of them, to Edinburgh, left his lands and his own
people, spending his money where it brought him not any esteem,
so that he was of no value either at home or abroad.&nbsp; We
mentioned Rob Roy, and the eyes <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>of all
glistened; even the lady of the house, who was very diffident,
and no great talker, exclaimed, &lsquo;He was a good man, Rob
Roy! he had been dead only about eighty years, had lived in the
next farm, which belonged to him, and there his bones were
laid.&rsquo; <a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp; He was a famous swordsman.&nbsp;
Having an arm much longer than other men, he had a greater
command with his sword.&nbsp; As a proof of the length of his
arm, they told us that he could garter his tartan stockings below
the knee without stooping, and added a dozen different stories of
single combats, which he had fought, all in perfect good-humour,
merely to prove his prowess.&nbsp; I daresay they had stories of
this kind which would hardly have been exhausted in the long
evenings of a whole December week, Rob Roy being as famous here
as ever Robin Hood was in the Forest of Sherwood; <i>he</i> also
robbed from the rich, giving to the poor, and defending them from
oppression.&nbsp; They tell of his confining the factor of the
Duke of Montrose in one of the islands of Loch Ketterine, after
having taken his money from him&mdash;the Duke&rsquo;s
rents&mdash;in open day, while they were sitting at table.&nbsp;
He was a formidable enemy of the Duke, but being a small laird
against a greater, was overcome at last, and forced to resign all
his lands on the Braes of Loch Lomond, including the caves which
we visited, on account of the money he had taken from the Duke
and could not repay.</p>

94</span>When breakfast was ended the mistress desired the person
whom we took to be her husband to &lsquo;return
thanks.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said a short grace, and in a few minutes
they all went off to their work.&nbsp; We saw them about the door
following one another like a flock of sheep, with the children
after, whatever job they were engaged in.&nbsp; Mrs. Macfarlane
told me she would show me the burying-place of the lairds of
Glengyle, and took me to a square enclosure like a pinfold, with
a stone ball at every corner; we had noticed it the evening
before, and wondered what it could be.&nbsp; It was in the middle
of a &lsquo;planting,&rsquo; as they call plantations, which was
enclosed for the preservation of the trees, therefore we had to
climb over a high wall: it was a dismal spot, containing four or
five graves overgrown with long grass, nettles, and
brambles.&nbsp; Against the wall was a marble monument to the
memory of one of the lairds, of whom they spoke with veneration:
some English verses were inscribed upon the marble, purporting
that he had been the father of his clan, a brave and good
man.&nbsp; When we returned to the house she said she would show
me what curious feathers they had in their country, and brought
out a bunch carefully wrapped up in paper.&nbsp; On my asking her
what bird they came from, &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she replied,
&lsquo;it is a great beast.&rsquo;&nbsp; We conjectured it was an
eagle, and from her description of its ways, and the manner of
destroying it, we knew it was so.&nbsp; She begged me to accept
of some of the feathers, telling me that some ladies wore them in
their heads.&nbsp; I was much pleased with the gift, which I
shall preserve in memory of her kindness and simplicity of
manners, and the Highland solitude where she lived.</p>
<p>We took leave of the family with regret: they were handsome,
healthy, and happy-looking people.&nbsp; It was ten <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>o&rsquo;clock when we departed.&nbsp; We had learned
that there was a ferry-boat kept at three miles&rsquo; distance,
and if the man was at home he would row us down the lake to the
Trossachs.&nbsp; Our walk was mostly through coppice-woods, along
a horse-road, upon which narrow carts might travel.&nbsp; Passed
that white house which had looked at us with such a friendly face
when we were on the other side; it stood on the slope of a hill,
with green pastures below it, plots of corn and coppice-wood, and
behind, a rocky steep covered with wood.&nbsp; It was a very
pretty place, but the morning being cold and dull the opposite
shore appeared dreary.&nbsp; Near to the white house we passed by
another of those little pinfold squares, which we knew to be a
burying-place; it was in a sloping green field among woods, and
within sound of the beating of the water against the shore, if
there were but a gentle breeze to stir it: I thought if I lived
in that house, and my ancestors and kindred were buried there, I
should sit many an hour under the walls of this plot of earth,
where all the household would be gathered together.</p>
<p>We found the ferryman at work in the field above his hut, and
he was at liberty to go with us, but, being wet and hungry, we
begged that he would let us sit by his fire till we had refreshed
ourselves.&nbsp; This was the first genuine Highland hut we had
been in.&nbsp; We entered by the cow-house, the house-door being
within, at right angles to the outer door.&nbsp; The woman was
distressed that she had a bad fire, but she heaped up some dry
peats and heather, and, blowing it with her breath, in a short
time raised a blaze that scorched us into comfortable
feelings.&nbsp; A small part of the smoke found its way out of
the hole of the chimney, the rest through the open window-places,
one of which was within the recess of the fireplace, and made a
frame <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>to a little picture of the restless
lake and the opposite shore, seen when the outer door was
open.&nbsp; The woman of the house was very kind: whenever we
asked her for anything it seemed a fresh pleasure to her that she
had it for us; she always answered with a sort of softening down
of the Scotch exclamation, &lsquo;Hoot!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ho!
yes, ye&rsquo;ll get that,&rsquo; and hied to her cupboard in the
spence.&nbsp; We were amused with the phrase &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll
get that&rsquo; in the Highlands, which appeared to us as if it
came from a perpetual feeling of the difficulty with which most
things are procured.&nbsp; We got oatmeal, butter, bread and
milk, made some porridge, and then departed.&nbsp; It was rainy
and cold, with a strong wind.</p>
<p>Coleridge was afraid of the cold in the boat, so he determined
to walk down the lake, pursuing the same road we had come
along.&nbsp; There was nothing very interesting for the first
three or four miles on either side of the water: to the right,
uncultivated heath or poor coppice-wood, and to the left, a
scattering of meadow ground, patches of corn, coppice-woods, and
here and there a cottage.&nbsp; The wind fell, and it began to
rain heavily.&nbsp; On this William wrapped himself in the
boatman&rsquo;s plaid, and lay at the bottom of the boat till we
came to a place where I could not help rousing him.</p>
<p>We were rowing down that side of the lake which had hitherto
been little else than a moorish ridge.&nbsp; After turning a
rocky point we came to a bay closed in by rocks and steep woods,
chiefly of full-grown birch.&nbsp; The lake was elsewhere
ruffled, but at the entrance of this bay the breezes sunk, and it
was calm: a small island was near, and the opposite shore,
covered with wood, looked soft through the misty rain.&nbsp;
William, rubbing his eyes, for he had been asleep, called out
that he hoped I had not let him <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>pass by
anything that was so beautiful as this; and I was glad to tell
him that it was but the beginning of a new land.&nbsp; After we
had left this bay we saw before us a long reach of woods and
rocks and rocky points, that promised other bays more beautiful
than what we had passed.&nbsp; The ferryman was a good-natured
fellow, and rowed very industriously, following the ins and outs
of the shore; he was delighted with the pleasure we expressed,
continually repeating how pleasant it would have been on a fine
day.&nbsp; I believe he was attached to the lake by some
sentiment of pride, as his own domain&mdash;his being almost the
only boat upon it&mdash;which made him, seeing we were willing
gazers, take far more pains than an ordinary boatman; he would
often say, after he had compassed the turning of a point,
&lsquo;This is a bonny part,&rsquo; and he always chose the
bonniest, with greater skill than our prospect-hunters and
&lsquo;picturesque travellers;&rsquo; places screened from the
winds&mdash;that was the first point; the rest followed of
course,&mdash;richer growing trees, rocks and banks, and curves
which the eye delights in.</p>
<p>The second bay we came to differed from the rest; the hills
retired a short space from the lake, leaving a few level fields
between, on which was a cottage embosomed in trees: the bay was
defended by rocks at each end, and the hills behind made a
shelter for the cottage, the only dwelling, I believe, except
one, on this side of Loch Ketterine.&nbsp; We now came to steeps
that rose directly from the lake, and passed by a place called in
the Gaelic the Den of the Ghosts, <a name="citation97"></a><a
href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a> which reminded us of
Lodore; it is a rock, or mass of rock, with a stream of large
black stones like the naked or dried-up bed of a torrent down the
side of it; <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>birch-trees start out of the rock in
every direction, and cover the hill above, further than we could
see.&nbsp; The water of the lake below was very deep, black, and
calm.&nbsp; Our delight increased as we advanced, till we came in
view of the termination of the lake, seeing where the river
issues out of it through a narrow chasm between the hills.</p>
<p>Here I ought to rest, as we rested, and attempt to give
utterance to our pleasure: but indeed I can impart but little of
what we felt.&nbsp; We were still on the same side of the water,
and, being immediately under the hill, within a considerable
bending of the shore, we were enclosed by hills all round, as if
we had been upon a smaller lake of which the whole was
visible.&nbsp; It was an entire solitude; and all that we beheld
was the perfection of loveliness and beauty.</p>
<p>We had been through many solitary places since we came into
Scotland, but this place differed as much from any we had seen
before, as if there had been nothing in common between them; no
thought of dreariness or desolation found entrance here; yet
nothing was to be seen but water, wood, rocks, and heather, and
bare mountains above.&nbsp; We saw the mountains by glimpses as
the clouds passed by them, and were not disposed to regret, with
our boatman, that it was not a fine day, for the near objects
were not concealed from us, but softened by being seen through
the mists.&nbsp; The lake is not very wide here, but appeared to
be much narrower than it really is, owing to the many
promontories, which are pushed so far into it that they are much
more like islands than promontories.&nbsp; We had a longing
desire to row to the outlet and look up into the narrow passage
through which the river went; but the point where we were to land
was on the other side, <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>so we bent our course right across,
and just as we came in sight of two huts, which have been built
by Lady Perth as a shelter for those who visit the Trossachs,
Coleridge hailed us with a shout of triumph from the door of one
of them, exulting in the glory of Scotland.&nbsp; The huts stand
at a small distance from each other, on a high and perpendicular
rock, that rises from the bed of the lake.&nbsp; A road, which
has a very wild appearance, has been cut through the rock; yet
even here, among these bold precipices, the feeling of excessive
beautifulness overcomes every other.&nbsp; While we were upon the
lake, on every side of us were bays within bays, often more like
tiny lakes or pools than bays, and these not in long succession
only, but all round, some almost on the broad breast of the
water, the promontories shot out so far.</p>
<p>After we had landed we walked along the road to the uppermost
of the huts, where Coleridge was standing.&nbsp; From the door of
this hut we saw Benvenue opposite to us&mdash;a high mountain,
but clouds concealed its top; its side, rising directly from the
lake, is covered with birch-trees to a great height, and seamed
with innumerable channels of torrents; but now there was no water
in them, nothing to break in upon the stillness and repose of the
scene; nor do I recollect hearing the sound of water from any
side, the wind being fallen and the lake perfectly still; the
place was all eye, and completely satisfied the sense and the
heart.&nbsp; Above and below us, to the right and to the left,
were rocks, knolls, and hills, which, wherever anything could
grow&mdash;and that was everywhere between the rocks&mdash;were
covered with trees and heather; the trees did not in any place
grow so thick as an ordinary wood; yet I think there was never a
bare space of twenty yards: it <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>was more
like a natural forest where the trees grow in groups or singly,
not hiding the surface of the ground, which, instead of being
green and mossy, was of the richest purple.&nbsp; The heather was
indeed the most luxuriant I ever saw; it was so tall that a child
of ten years old struggling through it would often have been
buried head and shoulders, and the exquisite beauty of the
colour, near or at a distance, seen under the trees, is not to be
conceived.&nbsp; But if I were to go on describing for evermore,
I should give but a faint, and very often a false, idea of the
different objects and the various combinations of them in this
most intricate and delicious place; besides, I tired myself out
with describing at Loch Lomond, so I will hasten to the end of my
tale.&nbsp; This reminds me of a sentence in a little pamphlet
written by the minister of Callander, descriptive of the environs
of that place.&nbsp; After having taken up at least six
closely-printed pages with the Trossachs, he concludes thus,
&lsquo;In a word, the Trossachs beggar all description,&rsquo; <a
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a>&mdash;a conclusion in which everybody
who has been there will agree with him.&nbsp; I believe the word
Trossachs signifies &lsquo;many hills:&rsquo; it is a name given
to all the eminences at the foot of Loch Ketterine, and about
half a mile beyond.</p>
<p>We left the hut, retracing the few yards of road which we had
climbed; our boat lay at anchor under the rock in the last of all
the compartments of the lake, a small oblong pool, almost shut up
within itself, as several others had appeared to be, by jutting
points of rock; the termination of a long out-shooting of the
water, pushed up between the steps of the main shore where the
huts stand, and a broad promontory which, with its hillocks and
points and lesser promontories, occupies the centre of the foot
of the lake.&nbsp; A person sailing through the lake up the
middle <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>of it, would just as naturally
suppose that the outlet was here as on the other side; and so it
might have been, with the most trifling change in the disposition
of the ground, for at the end of this slip of water the lake is
confined only by a gentle rising of a few yards towards an
opening between the hills, a narrow pass or valley through which
the river might have flowed.&nbsp; The road is carried through
this valley, which only differs from the lower part of the vale
of the lake in being excessively narrow, and without water; it is
enclosed by mountains, rocky mounds, hills and hillocks scattered
over with birch-trees, and covered with Dutch myrtle <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a> and heather, even surpassing what we
had seen before.&nbsp; Our mother Eve had no fairer, though a
more diversified garden, to tend, than we found within this
little close valley.&nbsp; It rained all the time, but the mists
and calm air made us ample amends for a wetting.</p>
<p>At the opening of the pass we climbed up a low eminence, and
had an unexpected prospect suddenly before us&mdash;another lake,
small compared with Loch Ketterine, though perhaps four miles
long, but the misty air concealed the end of it.&nbsp; The
transition from the solitary wildness of Loch Ketterine and the
narrow valley or pass to this scene was very delightful: it was a
gentle place, with lovely open bays, one small island, corn
fields, woods, and a group of cottages.&nbsp; This vale seemed to
have been made to be tributary to the comforts of man, Loch
Ketterine for the lonely delight of Nature, and kind spirits
delighting in beauty.&nbsp; The sky was grey and
heavy,&mdash;floating mists on the hill-sides, which softened the
objects, and where we lost sight of the lake it appeared so near
to the sky that they almost touched one another, giving a
visionary beauty to the prospect.&nbsp; While we overlooked this
quiet scene we could <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>hear the stream rumbling among the
rocks between the lakes, but the mists concealed any glimpse of
it which we might have had.&nbsp; This small lake is called Loch
Achray.</p>
<p>We returned, of course, by the same road.&nbsp; Our guide
repeated over and over again his lamentations that the day was so
bad, though we had often told him&mdash;not indeed with much hope
that he would believe us&mdash;that we were glad of it.&nbsp; As
we walked along he pulled a leafy twig from a birch-tree, and,
after smelling it, gave it to me, saying, how &lsquo;sweet and
halesome&rsquo; it was, and that it was pleasant and very
halesome on a fine summer&rsquo;s morning to sail under the banks
where the birks are growing.&nbsp; This reminded me of the old
Scotch songs, in which you continually hear of the
&lsquo;pu&rsquo;ing the birks.&rsquo;&nbsp; Common as birches are
in the north of England, I believe their sweet smell is a thing
unnoticed among the peasants.&nbsp; We returned again to the huts
to take a farewell look.&nbsp; We had shared our food with the
ferryman and a traveller whom we had met here, who was going up
the lake, and wished to lodge at the ferry-house, so we offered
him a place in the boat.&nbsp; Coleridge chose to walk.&nbsp; We
took the same side of the lake as before, and had much delight in
visiting the bays over again; but the evening began to darken,
and it rained so heavily before we had gone two miles that we
were completely wet.&nbsp; It was dark when we landed, and on
entering the house I was sick with cold.</p>
<p>The good woman had provided, according to her promise, a
better fire than we had found in the morning; and indeed when I
sate down in the chimney-corner of her smoky biggin&rsquo; I
thought I had never been more comfortable in my life.&nbsp;
Coleridge had been there long enough to have a pan of coffee
boiling for us, and having put our clothes in the <!-- page
103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>way of drying, we all sate down, thankful for a
shelter.&nbsp; We could not prevail upon the man of the house to
draw near the fire, though he was cold and wet, or to suffer his
wife to get him dry clothes till she had served us, which she
did, though most willingly, not very expeditiously.&nbsp; A
Cumberland man of the same rank would not have had such a notion
of what was fit and right in his own house, or if he had, one
would have accused him of servility; but in the Highlander it
only seemed like politeness, however erroneous and painful to us,
naturally growing out of the dependence of the inferiors of the
clan upon their laird; he did not, however, refuse to let his
wife bring out the whisky-bottle at our request: &lsquo;She keeps
a dram,&rsquo; as the phrase is; indeed, I believe there is
scarcely a lonely house by the wayside in Scotland where
travellers may not be accommodated with a dram.&nbsp; We asked
for sugar, butter, barley-bread, and milk, and with a smile and a
stare more of kindness than wonder, she replied,
&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll get that,&rsquo; bringing each article
separately.</p>
<p>We caroused our cups of coffee, laughing like children at the
strange atmosphere in which we were: the smoke came in gusts, and
spread along the walls and above our heads in the chimney, where
the hens were roosting like light clouds in the sky.&nbsp; We
laughed and laughed again, in spite of the smarting of our eyes,
yet had a quieter pleasure in observing the beauty of the beams
and rafters gleaming between the clouds of smoke.&nbsp; They had
been crusted over and varnished by many winters, till, where the
firelight fell upon them, they were as glossy as black rocks on a
sunny day cased in ice.&nbsp; When we had eaten our supper we
sate about half an hour, and I think I had never felt so deeply
the blessing of a <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>hospitable welcome and a warm
fire.&nbsp; The man of the house repeated from time to time that
we should often tell of this night when we got to our homes, and
interposed praises of this, his own lake, which he had more than
once, when we were returning in the boat, ventured to say was
&lsquo;bonnier than Loch Lomond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our companion from the Trossachs, who it appeared was an
Edinburgh drawing-master going during the vacation on a
pedestrian tour to John o&rsquo; Groat&rsquo;s House, was to
sleep in the barn with William and Coleridge, where the man said
he had plenty of dry hay.&nbsp; I do not believe that the hay of
the Highlands is often very dry, but this year it had a better
chance than usual: wet or dry, however, the next morning they
said they had slept comfortably.&nbsp; When I went to bed, the
mistress, desiring me to &lsquo;go ben,&rsquo; attended me with a
candle, and assured me that the bed was dry, though not
&lsquo;sic as I had been used to.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was of chaff;
there were two others in the room, a cupboard and two chests, on
one of which stood the milk in wooden vessels covered over; I
should have thought that milk so kept could not have been sweet,
but the cheese and butter were good.&nbsp; The walls of the whole
house were of stone unplastered.&nbsp; It consisted of three
apartments,&mdash;the cow-house at one end, the kitchen or house
in the middle, and the spence at the other end.&nbsp; The rooms
were divided, not up to the rigging, but only to the beginning of
the roof, so that there was a free passage for light and smoke
from one end of the house to the other.</p>
<p>I went to bed some time before the family.&nbsp; The door was
shut between us, and they had a bright fire, which I could not
see; but the light it sent up among the varnished rafters and
beams, which crossed each other in almost as intricate <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>and fantastic a manner as I have seen the under-boughs
of a large beech-tree withered by the depth of the shade above,
produced the most beautiful effect that can be conceived.&nbsp;
It was like what I should suppose an underground cave or temple
to be, with a dripping or moist roof, and the moonlight entering
in upon it by some means or other, and yet the colours were more
like melted gems.&nbsp; I lay looking up till the light of the
fire faded away, and the man and his wife and child had crept
into their bed at the other end of the room.&nbsp; I did not
sleep much, but passed a comfortable night, for my bed, though
hard, was warm and clean: the unusualness of my situation
prevented me from sleeping.&nbsp; I could hear the waves beat
against the shore of the lake; a little &lsquo;syke&rsquo; close
to the door made a much louder noise; and when I sate up in my
bed I could see the lake through an open window-place at the
bed&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Add to this, it rained all night.&nbsp; I
was less occupied by remembrance of the Trossachs, beautiful as
they were, than the vision of the Highland hut, which I could not
get out of my head.&nbsp; I thought of the Fairyland of Spenser,
and what I had read in romance at other times, and then, what a
feast would it be for a London pantomime-maker, could he but
transplant it to Drury Lane, with all its beautiful colours!</p>
<h2><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>THIRD WEEK.</h2>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>August</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;We were
desirous to have crossed the mountains above Glengyle to
Glenfalloch, at the head of Loch Lomond, but it rained so heavily
that it was impossible, so the ferryman engaged to row us to the
point where Coleridge and I had rested, while William was going
on our doubtful adventure.&nbsp; The hostess provided us with tea
and sugar for our breakfast; the water was boiled in an iron pan,
and dealt out to us in a jug, a proof that she does not often
drink tea, though she said she had always tea and sugar in the
house.&nbsp; She and the rest of the family breakfasted on curds
and whey, as taken out of the pot in which she was making cheese;
she insisted upon my taking some also; and her husband joined in
with the old story, that it was &lsquo;varra
halesome.&rsquo;&nbsp; I thought it exceedingly good, and said to
myself that they lived nicely with their cow: she was meat,
drink, and company.&nbsp; Before breakfast the housewife was
milking behind the chimney, and I thought I had seldom heard a
sweeter fire-side sound; in an evening, sitting over a sleepy,
low-burnt fire, it would lull one like the purring of a cat.</p>
<p>When we departed, the good woman shook me cordially by the
hand, saying she hoped that if ever we came into Scotland again,
we would come and see her.&nbsp; The lake was calm, but it rained
so heavily that we could see little.&nbsp; <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Landed at
about ten o&rsquo;clock, almost wet to the skin, and, with no
prospect but of streaming rains, faced the mountain-road to Loch
Lomond.&nbsp; We recognised the same objects passed
before,&mdash;the tarn, the potato-bed, and the cottages with
their burnies, which were no longer, as one might say, household
streams, but made us only think of the mountains and rocks they
came from.&nbsp; Indeed, it is not easy to imagine how different
everything appeared; the mountains with mists and torrents alive
and always changing: but the low grounds where the inhabitants
had been at work the day before were melancholy, with here and
there a few haycocks and hay scattered about.</p>
<p>Wet as we were, William and I turned out of our path to the
Garrison house.&nbsp; A few rooms of it seemed to be inhabited by
some wretchedly poor families, and it had all the desolation of a
large decayed mansion in the suburbs of a town, abandoned of its
proper inhabitants, and become the abode of paupers.&nbsp; In
spite of its outside bravery, it was but a poor protection
against &lsquo;the sword of winter, keen and cold.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We looked at the building through the arch of a broken gateway of
the courtyard, in the middle of which it stands.&nbsp; Upon that
stormy day it appeared more than desolate; there was something
about it even frightful.</p>
<p>When beginning to descend the hill towards Loch Lomond, we
overtook two girls, who told us we could not cross the ferry till
evening, for the boat was gone with a number of people to
church.&nbsp; One of the girls was exceedingly beautiful; and the
figures of both of them, in grey plaids falling to their feet,
their faces only being uncovered, excited our attention before we
spoke to them; but they answered us so sweetly that we were quite
delighted, at the same time that they stared at us with an
innocent <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>look of wonder.&nbsp; I think I
never heard the English language sound more sweetly than from the
mouth of the elder of these girls, while she stood at the gate
answering our inquiries, her face flushed with the rain; her
pronunciation was clear and distinct: without difficulty, yet
slow, like that of a foreign speech.&nbsp; They told us we might
sit in the ferry-house till the return of the boat, went in with
us, and made a good fire as fast as possible to dry our wet
clothes.&nbsp; We learnt that the taller was the sister of the
ferryman, and had been left in charge with the house for the day,
that the other was his wife&rsquo;s sister, and was come with her
mother on a visit,&mdash;an old woman, who sate in a corner
beside the cradle, nursing her little grandchild.&nbsp; We were
glad to be housed, with our feet upon a warm hearth-stone; and
our attendants were so active and good-humoured that it was
pleasant to have to desire them to do anything.&nbsp; The younger
was a delicate and unhealthy-looking girl; but there was an
uncommon meekness in her countenance, with an air of premature
intelligence, which is often seen in sickly young persons.&nbsp;
The other made me think of Peter Bell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Highland
Girl:&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;As light and beauteous as a squirrel,<br
/>
As beauteous and as wild.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She moved with unusual activity, which was chastened very
delicately by a certain hesitation in her looks when she spoke,
being able to understand us but imperfectly.&nbsp; They were both
exceedingly desirous to get me what I wanted to make me
comfortable.&nbsp; I was to have a gown and petticoat of the
mistress&rsquo;s; so they turned out her whole wardrobe upon the
parlour floor, talking Erse to one another, and laughing all the
time.&nbsp; It was long before <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>they could
decide which of the gowns I was to have; they chose at last, no
doubt thinking that it was the best, a light-coloured sprigged
cotton, with long sleeves, and they both laughed while I was
putting it on, with the blue linsey petticoat, and one or the
other, or both together, helped me to dress, repeating at least
half a dozen times, &lsquo;You never had on the like of that
before.&rsquo;&nbsp; They held a consultation of several minutes
over a pair of coarse woollen stockings, gabbling Erse as fast as
their tongues could move, and looked as if uncertain what to do:
at last, with great diffidence, they offered them to me, adding,
as before, that I had never worn &lsquo;the like of
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; When we entered the house we had been not a
little glad to see a fowl stewing in barley-broth; and now when
the wettest of our clothes were stripped off, began again to
recollect that we were hungry, and asked if we could have
dinner.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh yes, ye may get that,&rsquo; the elder
replied, pointing to the pan on the fire.</p>
<p>Conceive what a busy house it was&mdash;all our wet clothes to
be dried, dinner prepared and set out for us four strangers, and
a second cooking for the family; add to this, two rough
&lsquo;callans,&rsquo; as they called them, boys about eight
years old, were playing beside us; the poor baby was fretful all
the while; the old woman sang doleful Erse songs, rocking it in
its cradle the more violently the more it cried; then there were
a dozen cookings of porridge, and it could never be fed without
the assistance of all three.&nbsp; The hut was after the Highland
fashion, but without anything beautiful except its situation; the
floor was rough, and wet with the rain that came in at the door,
so that the lasses&rsquo; bare feet were as wet as if they had
been walking through street puddles, in passing from one room to
another; the <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>windows were open, as at the other
hut; but the kitchen had a bed in it, and was much smaller, and
the shape of the house was like that of a common English cottage,
without its comfort; yet there was no appearance of
poverty&mdash;indeed, quite the contrary.&nbsp; The peep out of
the open door-place across the lake made some amends for the want
of the long roof and elegant rafters of our boatman&rsquo;s
cottage, and all the while the waterfall, which we could not see,
was roaring at the end of the hut, which seemed to serve as a
sounding-board for its noise, so that it was not unlike sitting
in a house where a mill is going.&nbsp; The dashing of the waves
against the shore could not be distinguished; yet in spite of my
knowledge of this I could not help fancying that the tumult and
storm came from the lake, and went out several times to see if it
was possible to row over in safety.</p>
<p>After long waiting we grew impatient for our dinner; at last
the pan was taken off, and carried into the other room; but we
had to wait at least another half hour before the ceremony of
dishing up was completed; yet with all this bustle and
difficulty, the manner in which they, and particularly the elder
of the girls, performed everything, was perfectly graceful.&nbsp;
We ate a hearty dinner, and had time to get our clothes quite dry
before the arrival of the boat.&nbsp; The girls could not say at
what time it would be at home; on our asking them if the church
was far off they replied, &lsquo;Not very far;&rsquo; and when we
asked how far, they said, &lsquo;Perhaps about four or five
miles.&rsquo;&nbsp; I believe a Church of England congregation
would hold themselves excused for non-attendance three parts of
the year, having but half as far to go; but in the lonely parts
of Scotland they make little of a journey of nine or ten <!--
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>miles to a preaching.&nbsp; They have not perhaps an
opportunity of going more than once in a quarter of a year, and,
setting piety aside, have other motives to attend: they hear the
news, public and private, and see their friends and neighbours;
for, though the people who meet at these times may be gathered
together from a circle of twenty miles&rsquo; diameter, a sort of
neighbourly connexion must be so brought about.&nbsp; There is
something exceedingly pleasing to my imagination in this
gathering together of the inhabitants of these secluded
districts&mdash;for instance, the borderers of these two large
lakes meeting at the deserted garrison which I have
described.&nbsp; The manner of their travelling is on foot, on
horseback, and in boats across the waters,&mdash;young and old,
rich and poor, all in their best dress.</p>
<p>If it were not for these Sabbath-day meetings one summer month
would be like another summer month, one winter month like
another&mdash;detached from the goings-on of the world, and
solitary throughout; from the time of earliest childhood they
will be like landing-places in the memory of a person who has
passed his life in these thinly peopled regions; they must
generally leave distinct impressions, differing from each other
so much as they do in circumstances, in time and place,
etc.,&mdash;some in the open fields, upon hills, in houses, under
large rocks, in storms, and in fine weather.</p>
<p>But I have forgotten the fireside of our hut.&nbsp; After long
waiting, the girls, who had been on the look-out, informed us
that the boat was coming.&nbsp; I went to the water-side, and saw
a cluster of people on the opposite shore; but being yet at a
distance, they looked more like soldiers surrounding a carriage
than a group of men and women; red and green were the
distinguishable colours.&nbsp; <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>We hastened
to get ourselves ready as soon as we saw the party approach, but
had longer to wait than we expected, the lake being wider than it
appears to be.&nbsp; As they drew near we could distinguish men
in tartan plaids, women in scarlet cloaks, and green umbrellas by
the half-dozen.&nbsp; The landing was as pretty a sight as ever I
saw.&nbsp; The bay, which had been so quiet two days before, was
all in motion with small waves, while the swoln waterfall roared
in our ears.&nbsp; The boat came steadily up, being pressed
almost to the water&rsquo;s edge by the weight of its cargo;
perhaps twenty people landed, one after another.&nbsp; It did not
rain much, but the women held up their umbrellas; they were
dressed in all the colours of the rainbow, and, with their
scarlet cardinals, the tartan plaids of the men, and Scotch
bonnets, made a gay appearance.&nbsp; There was a joyous bustle
surrounding the boat, which even imparted something of the same
character to the waterfall in its tumult, and the restless grey
waves; the young men laughed and shouted, the lasses laughed, and
the elder folks seemed to be in a bustle to be away.&nbsp; I
remember well with what haste the mistress of the house where we
were ran up to seek after her child, and seeing us, how anxiously
and kindly she inquired how we had fared, if we had had a good
fire, had been well waited upon, etc. etc.&nbsp; All this in
three minutes&mdash;for the boatman had another party to bring
from the other side and hurried us off.</p>
<p>The hospitality we had met with at the two cottages and Mr.
Macfarlane&rsquo;s gave us very favourable impressions on this
our first entrance into the Highlands, and at this day the
innocent merriment of the girls, with their kindness to us, and
the beautiful figure and face of the elder, come to my mind
whenever I think of the ferry-house <!-- page 113--><a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>and
waterfall of Loch Lomond, and I never think of the two girls but
the whole image of that romantic spot is before me, a living
image, as it will be to my dying day.&nbsp; The following poem <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a> was written by William not long after
our return from Scotland:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower<br />
Of beauty is thy earthly dower!<br />
Twice seven consenting years have shed<br />
Their utmost bounty on thy head:<br />
And these grey rocks; this household lawn;<br />
These trees, a veil just half withdrawn;<br />
This fall of water, that doth make<br />
A murmur near the silent Lake;<br />
This little Bay, a quiet road<br />
That holds in shelter thy abode;<br />
In truth together ye do seem<br />
Like something fashion&rsquo;d in a dream;<br />
Such forms as from their covert peep<br />
When earthly cares are laid asleep!<br />
Yet, dream and vision as thou art,<br />
I bless thee with a human heart:<br />
God shield thee to thy latest years!<br />
I neither know thee nor thy peers;<br />
And yet my eyes are filled with tears.</p>
<p class="poetry">With earnest feeling I shall pray<br />
For thee when I am far away:<br />
For never saw I mien or face,<br />
In which more plainly I could trace<br />
Benignity and home-bred sense<br />
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br />
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Here, scattered like a random seed,<br />
Remote from men, thou dost not need<br />
Th&rsquo; embarrass&rsquo;d look of shy distress<br />
And maidenly shamefacedness;<br />
Thou wear&rsquo;st upon thy forehead clear<br />
The freedom of a mountaineer:<br />
A face with gladness overspread!<br />
Sweet smiles, by human-kindness bred!<br />
And seemliness complete, that sways<br />
Thy courtesies, about thee plays;<br />
With no restraint but such as springs<br />
From quick and eager visitings<br />
Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach<br />
Of thy few words of English speech:<br />
A bondage sweetly brook&rsquo;d, a strife<br />
That gives thy gestures grace and life!<br />
So have I, not unmoved in mind,<br />
Seen birds of tempest-loving kind,<br />
Thus beating up against the wind.</p>
<p class="poetry">What hand but would a garland cull<br />
For thee, who art so beautiful?<br />
O happy pleasure! here to dwell<br />
Beside thee in some heathy dell;<br />
Adopt your homely ways and dress,<br />
A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!<br />
But I could frame a wish for thee<br />
More like a grave reality:<br />
Thou art to me but as a wave<br />
Of the wild sea: and I would have<br />
Some claim upon thee, if I could,<br />
Though but of common neighbourhood.<br />
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>What joy to hear thee and to see!<br />
Thy elder brother I would be,<br />
Thy father&mdash;anything to thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace<br />
Hath led me to this lonely place!<br />
Joy have I had; and going hence<br />
I bear away my recompence.<br />
In spots like these it is we prize<br />
Our memory, feel that she hath eyes:<br />
Then why should I be loth to stir?<br />
I feel this place is made for her;<br />
To give new pleasure like the past<br />
Continued long as life shall last.<br />
Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,<br />
Sweet Highland Girl, from thee to part;<br />
For I, methinks, till I grow old,<br />
As fair before me shall behold<br />
As I do now, the Cabin small,<br />
The Lake, the Bay, the Waterfall,<br />
And thee, the Spirit of them all.</p>
<p>We were rowed over speedily by the assistance of two youths,
who went backwards and forwards for their own amusement, helping
at the oars, and pulled as if they had strength and spirits to
spare for a year to come.&nbsp; We noticed that they had
uncommonly fine teeth, and that they and the boatman were very
handsome people.&nbsp; Another merry crew took our place in the
boat.</p>
<p>We had three miles to walk to Tarbet.&nbsp; It rained, but not
heavily; the mountains were not concealed from us by the mists,
but appeared larger and more grand; twilight was coming on, and
the obscurity under which we saw the <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>objects,
with the sounding of the torrents, kept our minds alive and
wakeful; all was solitary and huge&mdash;sky, water, and
mountains mingled together.&nbsp; While we were walking forward,
the road leading us over the top of a brow, we stopped suddenly
at the sound of a half articulate Gaelic hooting from the field
close to us.&nbsp; It came from a little boy, whom we could see
on the hill between us and the lake, wrapped up in a grey
plaid.&nbsp; He was probably calling home the cattle for the
night.&nbsp; His appearance was in the highest degree moving to
the imagination: mists were on the hillsides, darkness shutting
in upon the huge avenue of mountains, torrents roaring, no house
in sight to which the child might belong; his dress, cry, and
appearance all different from anything we had been accustomed
to.&nbsp; It was a text, as William has since observed to me,
containing in itself the whole history of the Highlander&rsquo;s
life&mdash;his melancholy, his simplicity, his poverty, his
superstition, and above all, that visionariness which results
from a communion with the unworldliness of nature.</p>
<p>When we reached Tarbet the people of the house were anxious to
know how we had fared, particularly the girl who had waited upon
us.&nbsp; Our praises of Loch Ketterine made her exceedingly
happy, and she ventured to say, of which we had heard not a word
before, that it was &lsquo;bonnier to <i>her</i> fancy than Loch
Lomond.&rsquo; <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a>&nbsp; The landlord, who was not at
home when we had set off, told us that if he had known of our
going he would have recommended us to Mr. Macfarlane&rsquo;s or
the other farm-house, adding that they were hospitable people in
that vale.&nbsp; Coleridge and I got tea, and William and the
drawing-master chose supper; they asked to have a broiled fowl, a
dish very common in Scotland, to which the mistress replied,
&lsquo;Would not a &ldquo;boiled&rdquo; <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>one do as
well?&rsquo;&nbsp; They consented, supposing that it would be
more easily cooked; but when the fowl made its appearance, to
their great disappointment it proved a cold one that had been
stewed in the broth at dinner.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Monday</i>, <i>August</i> 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;It rained
heavily this morning, and, having heard so much of the long rains
since we came into Scotland, as well as before, we had no hope
that it would be over in less than three weeks at the least, so
poor Coleridge, being very unwell, determined to send his clothes
to Edinburgh and make the best of his way thither, being afraid
to face much wet weather in an open carriage.&nbsp; William and I
were unwilling to be confined at Tarbet, so we resolved to go to
Arrochar, a mile and a half on the road to Inverary, where there
is an inn celebrated as a place of good accommodation for
travellers.&nbsp; Coleridge and I set off on foot, and William
was to follow with the car, but a heavy shower coming on,
Coleridge left me to shelter in a hut and wait for William, while
he went on before.&nbsp; This hut was unplastered, and without
windows, crowded with beds, uncomfortable, and not in the
simplicity of the ferryman&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; A number of good
clothes were hanging against the walls, and a green silk umbrella
was set up in a corner.&nbsp; I should have been surprised to see
an umbrella in such a place before we came into the Highlands;
but umbrellas are not so common anywhere as there&mdash;a plain
proof of the wetness of the climate; even five minutes after this
a girl passed us without shoes and stockings, whose gown and
petticoat were not worth half a crown, holding an umbrella over
her bare head.</p>
<p>We turned at a guide-post, &lsquo;To the New Inn,&rsquo; and,
after descending a little, and winding round the bottom of a
hill, <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>saw, at a small distance, a white
house half hidden by tall trees upon a lawn that slopes down to
the side of Loch Long, a sea-loch, which is here very
narrow.&nbsp; Right before us, across the lake, was The Cobbler,
which appeared to rise directly from the water; but, in fact, it
overtopped another hill, being a considerable way behind.&nbsp;
The inn looked so much like a gentleman&rsquo;s house that we
could hardly believe it was an inn.&nbsp; We drove down the broad
gravel walk, and, making a sweep, stopped at the front door, were
shown into a large parlour with a fire, and my first thought was,
How comfortable we should be! but Coleridge, who had arrived
before us, checked my pleasure: the waiter had shown himself
disposed to look coolly upon us, and there had been a hint that
we could not have beds;&mdash;a party was expected, who had
engaged all the beds.&nbsp; We conjectured this might be but a
pretence, and ordered dinner in the hope that matters would clear
up a little, and we thought they could not have the heart to turn
us out in so heavy a rain if it were possible to lodge us.&nbsp;
We had a nice dinner, yet would have gladly changed our roasted
lamb and pickles, and the gentleman-waiter with his napkin in his
pocket, for the more homely fare of the smoky hut at Loch
Ketterine, and the good woman&rsquo;s busy attentions, with the
certainty of a hospitable shelter at night.&nbsp; After dinner I
spoke to the landlord himself, but he was not to be moved: he
could not even provide one bed for me, so nothing was to be done
but either to return to Tarbet with Coleridge, or that William
and I should push on the next stage, to Cairndow.&nbsp; We had an
interesting close view from the windows of the room where we
sate, looking across the lake, which did not differ in
appearance, as we saw it here, from a fresh-water lake.&nbsp; The
sloping lawn on which the <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>house stood
was prettily scattered over with trees; but we had seen the place
to great advantage at our first approach, owing to the mists upon
the mountains, which had made them seem exceedingly high, while
the strange figures on The Cobbler appeared and disappeared, like
living things; but, as the day cleared we were disappointed in
what was more like the permanent effect of the scene: the
mountains were not so lofty as we had supposed, and the low
grounds not so fertile; yet still it is a very interesting, I may
say beautiful, place.</p>
<p>The rain ceased entirely, so we resolved to go on to Cairndow,
and had the satisfaction of seeing that our landlord had not told
us an untruth concerning the expected company; for just before
our departure we saw, on the opposite side of the vale, a coach
with four horses, another carriage, and two or three men on
horseback&mdash;a striking procession, as it moved along between
the bare mountain and the lake.&nbsp; Twenty years ago, perhaps,
such a sight had not been seen here except when the Duke of
Argyle, or some other Highland chieftain, might chance to be
going with his family to London or Edinburgh.&nbsp; They had to
cross a bridge at the head of the lake, which we could not see,
so, after disappearing about ten minutes, they drove up to the
door&mdash;three old ladies, two waiting-women, and store of
men-servants.&nbsp; The old ladies were as gaily dressed as
bullfinches in spring-time.&nbsp; We heard the next day that they
were the renowned Miss Waughs of Carlisle, and that they enjoyed
themselves over a game at cards in the evening.</p>
<p>Left Arrochar at about four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon.&nbsp; Coleridge accompanied us a little way; we
portioned out the contents of our purse before our parting; and,
after we had lost sight of him, drove heavily along.&nbsp;
Crossed the <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>bridge, and looked to the right, up
the vale, which is soon terminated by mountains: it was of a
yellow green, with but few trees and few houses; sea-gulls were
flying above it.&nbsp; Our road&mdash;the same along which the
carriages had come&mdash;was directly under the mountains on our
right hand, and the lake was close to us on our left, the waves
breaking among stones overgrown with yellow sea-weed;
fishermen&rsquo;s boats, and other larger vessels than are seen
on fresh-water lakes were lying at anchor near the opposite
shore; seabirds flying overhead; the noise of torrents mingled
with the beating of the waves, and misty mountains enclosed the
vale;&mdash;a melancholy but not a dreary scene.&nbsp; Often have
I, in looking over a map of Scotland, followed the intricate
windings of one of these sea-lochs, till, pleasing myself with my
own imaginations, I have felt a longing, almost painful, to
travel among them by land or by water.</p>
<p>This was the first sea-loch we had seen.&nbsp; We came
prepared for a new and great delight, and the first impression
which William and I received, as we drove rapidly through the
rain down the lawn of Arrochar, the objects dancing before us,
was even more delightful than we had expected.&nbsp; But, as I
have said, when we looked through the window, as the mists
disappeared and the objects were seen more distinctly, there was
less of sheltered valley-comfort than we had fancied to
ourselves, and the mountains were not so grand; and now that we
were near to the shore of the lake, and could see that it was not
of fresh water, the wreck, the broken sea-shells, and scattered
sea-weed gave somewhat of a dull and uncleanly look to the whole
lake, and yet the water was clear, and might have appeared as
beautiful as that of Loch Lomond, if with the same pure pebbly
shore.&nbsp; Perhaps, had we been in a more cheerful <!-- page
121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>mood of mind we might have seen everything with a
different eye.&nbsp; The stillness of the mountains, the motion
of the waves, the streaming torrents, the sea-birds, the
fishing-boats were all melancholy; yet still, occupied as my mind
was with other things, I thought of the long windings through
which the waters of the sea had come to this inland retreat,
visiting the inner solitudes of the mountains, and I could have
wished to have mused out a summer&rsquo;s day on the shores of
the lake.&nbsp; From the foot of these mountains whither might
not a little barque carry one away?&nbsp; Though so far inland,
it is but a slip of the great ocean: seamen, fishermen, and
shepherds here find a natural home.&nbsp; We did not travel far
down the lake, but, turning to the right through an opening of
the mountains, entered a glen called Glen Croe.</p>
<p>Our thoughts were full of Coleridge, and when we were enclosed
in the narrow dale, with a length of winding road before us, a
road that seemed to have insinuated itself into the very heart of
the mountains&mdash;the brook, the road, bare hills, floating
mists, scattered stones, rocks, and herds of black cattle being
all that we could see,&mdash;I shivered at the thought of his
being sickly and alone, travelling from place to place.</p>
<p>The Cobbler, on our right, was pre-eminent above the other
hills; the singular rocks on its summit, seen so near, were like
ruins&mdash;castles or watch-towers.&nbsp; After we had passed
one reach of the glen, another opened out, long, narrow, deep,
and houseless, with herds of cattle and large stones; but the
third reach was softer and more beautiful, as if the mountains
had there made a warmer shelter, and there were a more gentle
climate.&nbsp; The rocks by the riverside had dwindled away, the
mountains were smooth and <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>green, and
towards the end, where the glen sloped upwards, it was a
cradle-like hollow, and at that point where the slope became a
hill, at the very bottom of the curve of the cradle, stood one
cottage, with a few fields and beds of potatoes.&nbsp; There was
also another house near the roadside, which appeared to be a
herdsman&rsquo;s hut.&nbsp; The dwelling in the middle of the
vale was a very pleasing object.&nbsp; I said within myself, How
quietly might a family live in this pensive solitude, cultivating
and loving their own fields! but the herdsman&rsquo;s hut, being
the only one in the vale, had a melancholy face; not being
attached to any particular plot of land, one could not help
considering it as just kept alive and above ground by some dreary
connexion with the long barren tract we had travelled
through.</p>
<p>The afternoon had been exceedingly pleasant after we had left
the vale of Arrochar; the sky was often threatening, but the rain
blew off, and the evening was uncommonly fine.&nbsp; The sun had
set a short time before we had dismounted from the car to walk up
the steep hill at the end of the glen.&nbsp; Clouds were moving
all over the sky&mdash;some of a brilliant yellow hue, which shed
a light like bright moonlight upon the mountains.&nbsp; We could
not have seen the head of the valley under more favourable
circumstances.</p>
<p>The passing away of a storm is always a time of life and
cheerfulness, especially in a mountainous country; but that
afternoon and evening the sky was in an extraordinary degree
vivid and beautiful.&nbsp; We often stopped in ascending the hill
to look down the long reach of the glen.&nbsp; The road,
following the course of the river as far as we could see, the
farm and cottage hills, smooth towards the base and rocky higher
up, were the sole objects before us.&nbsp; This <!-- page
123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>part of Glen Croe reminded us of some of the dales of
the north of England&mdash;Grisdale above Ulswater, for instance;
but the length of it, and the broad highway, which is always to
be seen at a great distance, a sort of centre of the vale, a
point of reference, gives to the whole of the glen, and each
division of it, a very different character.</p>
<p>At the top of the hill we came to a seat with the well-known
inscription, &lsquo;Rest and be thankful.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the
same stone it was recorded that the road had been made by Col.
Wade&rsquo;s regiment.&nbsp; The seat is placed so as to command
a full view of the valley, and the long, long road, which, with
the fact recorded, and the exhortation, makes it an affecting
resting-place.&nbsp; We called to mind with pleasure a seat under
the braes of Loch Lomond on which I had rested, where the
traveller is informed by an inscription upon a stone that the
road was made by Col. Lascelles&rsquo; regiment.&nbsp; There, the
spot had not been chosen merely as a resting-place, for there was
no steep ascent in the highway, but it might be for the sake of a
spring of water and a beautiful rock, or, more probably, because
at that point the labour had been more than usually toilsome in
hewing through the rock.&nbsp; Soon after we had climbed the hill
we began to descend into another glen, called Glen Kinglas.&nbsp;
We now saw the western sky, which had hitherto been hidden from
us by the hill&mdash;a glorious mass of clouds uprising from a
sea of distant mountains, stretched out in length before us,
towards the west&mdash;and close by us was a small lake or
tarn.&nbsp; From the reflection of the crimson clouds the water
appeared of a deep red, like melted rubies, yet with a mixture of
a grey or blackish hue: the gorgeous light of the sky, with the
singular colour of the lake, made the scene exceedingly romantic;
yet it was <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>more melancholy than cheerful.&nbsp;
With all the power of light from the clouds, there was an
overcasting of the gloom of evening, a twilight upon the
hills.</p>
<p>We descended rapidly into the glen, which resembles the lower
part of Glen Croe, though it seemed to be inferior in beauty; but
before we had passed through one reach it was quite dark, and I
only know that the steeps were high, and that we had the company
of a foaming stream; and many a vagrant torrent crossed us,
dashing down the hills.&nbsp; The road was bad, and, uncertain
how we should fare, we were eager and somewhat uneasy to get
forward; but when we were out of the close glen, and near to
Cairndow, as a traveller had told us, the moon showed her clear
face in the sky, revealing a spacious vale, with a broad loch and
sloping corn fields; the hills not very high.&nbsp; This cheerful
sight put us into spirits, and we thought it was at least no
dismal place to sit up all night in, if they had no beds, and
they could not refuse us a shelter.&nbsp; We were, however, well
received, and sate down in a neat parlour with a good fire.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>August</i> 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Breakfasted
before our departure, and ate a herring, fresh from the water, at
our landlord&rsquo;s earnest recommendation&mdash;much superior
to the herrings we get in the north of England. <a
name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a>&nbsp; Though we rose at seven, could
not set off before nine o&rsquo;clock; the servants were in bed;
the kettle did not boil&mdash;indeed, we were completely out of
patience; but it had always been so, and we resolved to go off in
future without breakfast.&nbsp; Cairndow is a single house by the
side of the loch, I believe resorted to by gentlemen in the
fishing season: it is <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>a pleasant place for such a purpose;
but the vale did not look so beautiful as by moonlight&mdash;it
had a sort of sea-coldness without mountain grandeur.&nbsp; There
is a ferry for foot-passengers from Cairndow to the other side of
the water, and the road along which all carriages go is carried
round the head of the lake, perhaps a distance of three
miles.</p>
<p>After we had passed the landing-place of the ferry opposite to
Cairndow we saw the lake spread out to a great width, more like
an arm of the sea or a great river than one of our lakes; it
reminded us of the Severn at the Chepstow passage; but the shores
were less rich and the hills higher.&nbsp; The sun shone, which
made the morning cheerful, though there was a cold wind.&nbsp;
Our road never carried us far from the lake, and with the beating
of the waves, the sparkling sunshiny water, boats, the opposite
hills, and, on the side on which we travelled, the chance
cottages, the coppice woods, and common business of the fields,
the ride could not but be amusing.&nbsp; But what most excited
our attention was, at one particular place, a cluster of
fishing-boats at anchor in a still corner of the lake, a small
bay or harbour by the wayside.&nbsp; They were overshadowed by
fishermen&rsquo;s nets hung out to dry, which formed a dark
awning that covered them like a tent, overhanging the water on
each side, and falling in the most exquisitely graceful
folds.&nbsp; There was a monastic pensiveness, a funereal gloom
in the appearance of this little company of vessels, which was
the more interesting from the general liveliness and glancing
motions of the water, they being perfectly still and silent in
their sheltered nook.</p>
<p>When we had travelled about seven miles from Cairndow, winding
round the bottom of a hill, we came in view of a great basin or
elbow of the lake.&nbsp; Completely out of <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>sight of
the long track of water we had coasted, we seemed now to be on
the edge of a very large, almost circular, lake, the town of
Inverary before us, a line of white buildings on a low promontory
right opposite, and close to the water&rsquo;s edge; the whole
landscape a showy scene, and bursting upon us at once.&nbsp; A
traveller who was riding by our side called out, &lsquo;Can that
be the Castle?&rsquo;&nbsp; Recollecting the prints which we had
seen, we knew it could not; but the mistake is a natural one at
that distance: it is so little like an ordinary town, from the
mixture of regularity and irregularity in the buildings.&nbsp;
With the expanse of water and pleasant mountains, the scattered
boats and sloops, and those gathered together, it had a truly
festive appearance.&nbsp; A few steps more brought us in view of
the Castle, a stately turreted mansion, but with a modern air,
standing on a lawn, retired from the water, and screened behind
by woods covering the sides of high hills to the top, and still
beyond, by bare mountains.&nbsp; Our road wound round the
semicircular shore, crossing two bridges of lordly
architecture.&nbsp; The town looked pretty when we drew near to
it in connexion with its situation, different from any place I
had ever seen, yet exceedingly like what I imaged to myself from
representations in raree-shows, or pictures of foreign
places&mdash;Venice, for example&mdash;painted on the scene of a
play-house, which one is apt to fancy are as cleanly and gay as
they look through the magnifying-glass of the raree-show or in
the candle-light dazzle of a theatre.&nbsp; At the door of the
inn, though certainly the buildings had not that delightful
outside which they appeared to have at a distance, yet they
looked very pleasant.&nbsp; The range bordering on the water
consisted of little else than the inn, being a large house, with
very large stables, the county <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>gaol, the
opening into the main street into the town, and an arched
gateway, the entrance into the Duke of Argyle&rsquo;s private
domain.</p>
<p>We were decently well received at the inn, but it was
over-rich in waiters and large rooms to be exactly to our taste,
though quite in harmony with the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Before
dinner we went into the Duke&rsquo;s pleasure-grounds, which are
extensive, and of course command a variety of lively and
interesting views.&nbsp; Walked through avenues of tall
beech-trees, and observed some that we thought even the tallest
we had ever seen; but they were all scantily covered with leaves,
and the leaves exceedingly small&mdash;indeed, some of them, in
the most exposed situations, were almost bare, as if it had been
winter.&nbsp; Travellers who wish to view the inside of the
Castle send in their names, and the Duke appoints the time of
their going; but we did not think that what we should see would
repay us for the trouble, there being no pictures, and the house,
which I believe has not been built above half a century, is
fitted up in the modern style.&nbsp; If there had been any
reliques of the ancient costume of the castle of a Highland
chieftain, we should have been sorry to have passed it.</p>
<p>Sate after dinner by the fireside till near sunset, for it was
very cold, though the sun shone all day.&nbsp; At the beginning
of this our second walk we passed through the town, which is but
a doleful example of Scotch filth.&nbsp; The houses are plastered
or rough-cast, and washed yellow&mdash;well built, well sized,
and sash-windowed, bespeaking a connexion with the Duke, such a
dependence as may be expected in a small town so near to his
mansion; and indeed he seems to have done his utmost to make them
<!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>comfortable, according to our English notions of
comfort: they are fit for the houses of people living decently
upon a decent trade; but the windows and door-steads were as
dirty as in a dirty by-street of a large town, making a most
unpleasant contrast with the comely face of the buildings towards
the water, and the ducal grandeur and natural festivity of the
scene.&nbsp; Smoke and blackness are the wild growth of a
Highland hut: the mud floors cannot be washed, the door-steads
are trampled by cattle, and if the inhabitants be not very
cleanly it gives one little pain; but dirty people living in
two-storied stone houses, with dirty sash windows, are a
melancholy spectacle anywhere, giving the notion either of vice
or the extreme of wretchedness.</p>
<p>Returning through the town, we went towards the Castle, and
entered the Duke&rsquo;s grounds by a porter&rsquo;s lodge,
following the carriage-road through the park, which is prettily
scattered over with trees, and slopes gently towards the
lake.&nbsp; A great number of lime-trees were growing singly, not
beautiful in their shape, but I mention them for the resemblance
to one of the same kind we had seen in the morning, which formed
a shade as impenetrable as the roof of any house.&nbsp; The
branches did not spread far, nor any one branch much further than
another; on the outside it was like a green bush shorn with
shears, but when we sate upon a bench under it, looking upwards,
in the middle of the tree we could not perceive any green at all;
it was like a hundred thousand magpies&rsquo; nests clustered and
matted together, the twigs and boughs being so intertwined that
neither the light of the mid-day sun nor showers of hail or rain
could pierce through them.&nbsp; The lime-trees on the lawn
resembled this <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>tree both in shape and in the manner
of intertwisting their twigs, but they were much smaller, and not
an impenetrable shade.</p>
<p>The views from the Castle are delightful.&nbsp; Opposite is
the lake, girt with mountains, or rather smooth high hills; to
the left appears a very steep rocky hill, called Duniquoich Hill,
on the top of which is a building like a watch-tower; it rises
boldly and almost perpendicular from the plain, at a little
distance from the river Arey, that runs through the
grounds.&nbsp; To the right is the town, overtopped by a sort of
spire or pinnacle of the church, a thing unusual in Scotland,
except in the large towns, and which would often give an elegant
appearance to the villages, which, from the uniformity of the
huts, and the frequent want of tall trees, they seldom
exhibit.</p>
<p>In looking at an extensive prospect, or travelling through a
large vale, the Trough of the Clyde for instance, I could not
help thinking that in England there would have been somewhere a
tower or spire to warn us of a village lurking under the covert
of a wood or bank, or to point out some particular spot on the
distant hills which we might look at with kindly feelings.&nbsp;
I well remember how we used to love the little nest of trees out
of which Ganton spire rose on the distant Wolds opposite to the
windows at Gallow Hill.&nbsp; The spire of Inverary is not of so
beautiful a shape as those of the English churches, and, not
being one of a class of buildings which is understood at once,
seen near or at a distance, is a less interesting object; but it
suits well with the outlandish trimness of the buildings
bordering on the water; indeed, there is no one thing of the many
gathered together in the extensive circuit of the basin or vale
of Inverary, that is not in <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>harmony
with the effect of the whole place.&nbsp; The Castle is built of
a beautiful hewn stone, in colour resembling our blue
slates.&nbsp; The author-tourists have quarrelled with the
architecture of it, but we did not find much that we were
disposed to blame.&nbsp; A castle in a deep glen, overlooking a
roaring stream, and defended by precipitous rocks, is, no doubt,
an object far more interesting; but, dropping all ideas of danger
or insecurity, the natural retinue in our minds of an ancient
Highland chieftain,&mdash;take a Duke of Argyle at the end of the
eighteenth century, let him have his house in Grosvenor Square,
his London liveries, and daughters glittering at St.
James&rsquo;s, and I think you will be satisfied with his present
mansion in the Highlands, which seems to suit with the present
times and its situation, and that is indeed a noble one for a
modern Duke of the mountainous district of Argyleshire, with its
bare valleys, its rocky coasts, and sea lochs.</p>
<p>There is in the natural endowments of Inverary something akin
to every feature of the general character of the county; yet even
the very mountains and the lake itself have a kind of princely
festivity in their appearance.&nbsp; I do not know how to
communicate the feeling, but it seemed as if it were no insult to
the hills to look on them as the shield and enclosure of the
ducal domain, to which the water might delight in bearing its
tribute.&nbsp; The hills near the lake are smooth, so smooth that
they might have been shaven or swept; the shores, too, had
somewhat of the same effect, being bare, and having no roughness,
no woody points; yet the whole circuit being very large, and the
hills so extensive, the scene was not the less cheerful and
festive, rejoicing in the light of heaven.&nbsp; Behind the
Castle the hills are planted to a great height, and the
pleasure-grounds <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>extend far up the valley of
Arey.&nbsp; We continued our walk a short way along the river,
and were sorry to see it stripped of its natural ornaments, after
the fashion of Mr. Brown, <a name="citation131"></a><a
href="#footnote131" class="citation">[131]</a> and left to tell
its tale&mdash;for it would not be silent like the river at
Blenheim&mdash;to naked fields and the planted trees on the
hills.&nbsp; We were disgusted with the stables, outhouses, or
farm-houses in different parts of the grounds behind the Castle:
they were broad, out-spreading, fantastic, and unintelligible
buildings.</p>
<p>Sate in the park till the moonlight was perceived more than
the light of day.&nbsp; We then walked near the town by the
water-side.&nbsp; I observed that the children who were playing
did not speak Erse, but a much worse English than is spoken by
those Highlanders whose common language is the Erse.&nbsp; I went
into the town to purchase tea and sugar to carry with us on our
journey.&nbsp; We were tired when we returned to the inn, and
went to bed directly after tea.&nbsp; My room was at the very top
of the house&mdash;one flight of steps after another!&mdash;but
when I drew back the curtains of my window I was repaid for the
trouble of panting up-stairs by one of the most splendid
moonlight prospects that can be conceived: the whole circuit of
the hills, the Castle, the two bridges, the tower on Duniquoich
Hill, and the lake with many boats&mdash;fit scene for summer
midnight festivities!&nbsp; I should have liked to have seen a
bevy of Scottish ladies sailing, with music, in a gay
barge.&nbsp; William, to whom I have read this, tells me that I
have used the very words of Browne of Ottery, Coleridge&rsquo;s
fellow-townsman:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;As I have seen when on the breast of
Thames<br />
A heavenly bevy of sweet English dames,<br />
<!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>August</i> 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;We had a
long day&rsquo;s journey before us, without a regular
baiting-place on the road, so we breakfasted at Inverary, and did
not set off till nine o&rsquo;clock, having, as usual, to
complain of the laziness of the servants.&nbsp; Our road was up
the valley behind the Castle, the same we had gone along the
evening before.&nbsp; Further up, though the plantations on the
hills are noble, the valley was cold and naked, wanting hedgerows
and comfortable houses.&nbsp; We travelled several miles under
the plantations, the vale all along seeming to belong almost
exclusively to the Castle.&nbsp; It might have been better
distinguished and adorned, as we thought, by neater farm-houses
and cottages than are common in Scotland, and snugger fields with
warm hedgerows, at the same time testifying as boldly its
adherence to the chief.</p>
<p>At that point of the valley where the pleasure-grounds appear
to end, we left our horse at a cottage door, and turned a few
steps out of the road to see a waterfall, which roared so loud
that we could not have gone by without looking about for it, even
if we had not known that there was one near Inverary.&nbsp; The
waterfall is not remarkable for anything but the good taste with
which it has been left to itself, though there is a pleasure-road
from the Castle to it.&nbsp; As we went further up the valley the
roads died away, and it became an ordinary Scotch glen, the poor
pasturage of the hills creeping down into the valley, where it
was little better for the shelter, <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>I mean
little greener than on the hill-sides; but a man must be of a
churlish nature if, with a mind free to look about, he should not
find such a glen a pleasing place to travel through, though
seeing little but the busy brook, with here and there a bush or
tree, and cattle pasturing near the thinly-scattered
dwellings.&nbsp; But we came to one spot which I cannot forget, a
single green field at the junction of another brook with the
Arey, a peninsula surrounded with a close row of trees, which
overhung the streams, and under their branches we could just see
a neat white house that stood in the middle of the field enclosed
by the trees.&nbsp; Before us was nothing but bare hills, and the
road through the bare glen.&nbsp; A person who has not travelled
in Scotland can scarcely imagine the pleasure we have had from a
stone house, though fresh from the workmen&rsquo;s hands, square
and sharp; there is generally such an appearance of equality in
poverty through the long glens of Scotland, giving the notion of
savage ignorance&mdash;no house better than another, and barns
and houses all alike.&nbsp; This house had, however, other
recommendations of its own; even in the fertile parts of
Somersetshire it would have been a delicious spot; here,
&lsquo;&rsquo;Mid mountain wild set like a little nest,&rsquo; it
was a resting-place for the fancy, and to this day I often think
of it, the cottage and its green covert, as an image of romance,
a place of which I have the same sort of knowledge as of some of
the retirements, the little valleys, described so livelily by
Spenser in his Fairy Queen.</p>
<p>We travelled on, the glen now becoming entirely bare.&nbsp;
Passed a miserable hut on a naked hill-side, not far from the
road, where we were told by a man who came out of it that we
might refresh ourselves with a dram of whisky.&nbsp; <!-- page
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Went over the hill, and saw nothing remarkable till we
came in view of Loch Awe, a large lake far below us, among high
mountains&mdash;one very large mountain right opposite, which we
afterwards found was called Cruachan.&nbsp; The day was
pleasant&mdash;sunny gleams and a fresh breeze; the lake&mdash;we
looked across it&mdash;as bright as silver, which made the
islands, three or four in number, appear very green.&nbsp; We
descended gladly, invited by the prospect before us, travelling
downwards, along the side of the hill, above a deep glen, woody
towards the lower part near the brook; the hills on all sides
were high and bare, and not very stony: it made us think of the
descent from Newlands into Buttermere, though on a wider scale,
and much inferior in simple majesty.</p>
<p>After walking down the hill a long way we came to a bridge,
under which the water dashed through a dark channel of rocks
among trees, the lake being at a considerable distance below,
with cultivated lands between.&nbsp; Close upon the bridge was a
small hamlet, <a name="citation134"></a><a href="#footnote134"
class="citation">[134]</a> a few houses near together, and
huddled up in trees&mdash;a very sweet spot, the only retired
village we had yet seen which was characterized by
&lsquo;beautiful&rsquo; wildness with sheltering warmth.&nbsp; We
had been told at Inverary that we should come to a place where we
might give our horse a feed of corn, and found on inquiry that
there was a little public-house here, or rather a hut
&lsquo;where they kept a dram.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a cottage,
like all the rest, without a sign-board.&nbsp; The woman of the
house helped to take the horse out of harness, and, being hungry,
we asked her if she could make us some porridge, to which she
replied that &lsquo;we should get that,&rsquo; and I followed her
into the house, and sate over her hearth while <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>she was
making it.&nbsp; As to fire, there was little sign of it, save
the smoke, for a long time, she having no fuel but green wood,
and no bellows but her breath.&nbsp; My eyes smarted exceedingly,
but the woman seemed so kind and cheerful that I was willing to
endure it for the sake of warming my feet in the ashes and
talking to her.&nbsp; The fire was in the middle of the room, a
crook being suspended from a cross-beam, and a hole left at the
top for the smoke to find its way out by: it was a rude Highland
hut, unadulterated by Lowland fashions, but it had not the
elegant shape of the ferry-house at Loch Ketterine, and the fire,
being in the middle of the room, could not be such a snug place
to draw to on a winter&rsquo;s night.</p>
<p>We had a long afternoon before us, with only eight miles to
travel to Dalmally, and, having been told that a ferry-boat was
kept at one of the islands, we resolved to call for it, and row
to the island, so we went to the top of an eminence, and the man
who was with us set some children to work to gather sticks and
withered leaves to make a smoky fire&mdash;a signal for the
boatman, whose hut is on a flat green island, like a sheep
pasture, without trees, and of a considerable size: the man told
us it was a rabbit-warren.&nbsp; There were other small islands,
on one of which was a ruined house, fortification, or small
castle: we could not learn anything of its history, only a girl
told us that formerly gentlemen lived in such places.&nbsp;
Immediately from the water&rsquo;s edge rose the mountain
Cruachan on the opposite side of the lake; it is woody near the
water and craggy above, with deep hollows on the surface.&nbsp;
We thought it the grandest mountain we had seen, and on saying to
the man who was with us that it was a fine mountain,
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;it is an excellent
mountain,&rsquo; adding that it was higher than Ben <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>Lomond, and then told us some wild stories of the
enormous profits it brought to Lord Breadalbane, its lawful
owner.&nbsp; The shape of Loch Awe is very remarkable, its outlet
being at one side, and only about eight miles from the head, and
the whole lake twenty-four miles in length.&nbsp; We looked with
longing after that branch of it opposite to us out of which the
water issues: it seemed almost like a river gliding under steep
precipices.&nbsp; What we saw of the larger branch, or what might
be called the body of the lake, was less promising, the banks
being merely gentle slopes, with not very high mountains behind,
and the ground moorish and cold.</p>
<p>The children, after having collected fuel for our fire, began
to play on the green hill where we stood, as heedless as if we
had been trees or stones, and amused us exceedingly with their
activity: they wrestled, rolled down the hill, pushing one
another over and over again, laughing, screaming, and chattering
Erse: they were all without shoes and stockings, which, making
them fearless of hurting or being hurt, gave a freedom to the
action of their limbs which I never saw in English children: they
stood upon one another, body, breast, or face, or any other part;
sometimes one was uppermost, sometimes another, and sometimes
they rolled all together, so that we could not know to which body
this leg or that arm belonged.&nbsp; We waited, watching them,
till we were assured that the boatman had noticed our
signal&mdash;By the bye, if we had received proper directions at
Loch Lomond, on our journey to Loch Ketterine, we should have
made our way down the lake till we had come opposite to the
ferryman&rsquo;s house, where there is a hut, and the people who
live there are accustomed to call him by the same signal as
here.&nbsp; Luckily for us we were not so well instructed, for we
should have missed the <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>pleasure of
receiving the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Macfarlane and their
family.</p>
<p>A young woman who wanted to go to the island accompanied us to
the water-side.&nbsp; The walk was pleasant, through fields with
hedgerows, the greenest fields we had seen in Scotland; but we
were obliged to return without going to the island.&nbsp; The
poor man had taken his boat to another place, and the waters were
swollen so that we could not go close to the shore, and show
ourselves to him, nor could we make him hear by shouting.&nbsp;
On our return to the public-house we asked the woman what we
should pay her, and were not a little surprised when she
answered, &lsquo;Three shillings.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our horse had had
a sixpenny feed of miserable corn, not worth threepence; the rest
of the charge was for skimmed milk, oat-bread, porridge, and blue
milk cheese: we told her it was far too much; and, giving her
half-a-crown, departed.&nbsp; I was sorry she had made this
unreasonable demand, because we had liked the woman, and we had
before been so well treated in the Highland cottages; but, on
thinking more about it, I satisfied myself that it was no scheme
to impose upon us, for she was contented with the half-crown, and
would, I daresay, have been so with two shillings, if we had
offered it her at first.&nbsp; Not being accustomed to fix a
price upon porridge and milk, to such as we, at least, when we
asked her she did not know what to say; but, seeing that we were
travelling for pleasure, no doubt she concluded we were rich, and
that what was a small gain to her could be no great loss to
us.</p>
<p>When we had gone a little way we saw before us a young man
with a bundle over his shoulder, hung on a stick, bearing a great
boy on his back: seeing that they were travellers, we offered to
take the boy on the car, <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>to which
the man replied that he should be more than thankful, and set him
up beside me.&nbsp; They had walked from Glasgow, and that
morning from Inverary; the boy was only six years old,
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said his father, &lsquo;he is a stout
walker,&rsquo; and a fine fellow he was, smartly dressed in tight
clean clothes and a nice round hat: he was going to stay with his
grandmother at Dalmally.&nbsp; I found him good company; though I
could not draw a single word out of him, it was a pleasure to see
his happiness gleaming through the shy glances of his healthy
countenance.&nbsp; Passed a pretty chapel by the lake-side, and
an island with a farm-house upon it, and corn and pasture fields;
but, as we went along, we had frequent reason to regret the want
of English hedgerows and English culture; for the ground was
often swampy or moorish near the lake where comfortable dwellings
among green fields might have been.&nbsp; When we came near to
the end of the lake we had a steep hill to climb, so William and
I walked; and we had such confidence in our horse that we were
not afraid to leave the car to his guidance with the child in it;
we were soon, however, alarmed at seeing him trot up the hill a
long way before us; the child, having raised himself up upon the
seat, was beating him as hard as he could with a little stick
which he carried in his hand; and when he saw our eyes were on
him he sate down, I believe very sorry to resign his office: the
horse slackened his pace, and no accident happened.</p>
<p>When we had ascended half-way up the hill, directed by the
man, I took a nearer footpath, and at the top came in view of a
most impressive scene, a ruined castle on an island almost in the
middle of the last compartment of the lake, backed by a mountain
cove, down which came a roaring <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>stream.&nbsp; The castle occupied every foot of the
island that was visible to us, appearing to rise out of the
water; mists rested upon the mountain side, with spots of
sunshine between; there was a mild desolation in the low grounds,
a solemn grandeur in the mountains, and the castle was wild, yet
stately, not dismantled of its turrets, nor the walls broken
down, though completely in ruin.&nbsp; After having stood some
minutes I joined William on the high road, and both wishing to
stay longer near this place, we requested the man to drive his
little boy on to Dalmally, about two miles further, and leave the
car at the inn.&nbsp; He told us that the ruin was called
Kilchurn Castle, that it belonged to Lord Breadalbane, and had
been built by one of the ladies of that family for her defence
during her Lord&rsquo;s absence at the Crusades, for which
purpose she levied a tax of seven years&rsquo; rent upon her
tenants; <a name="citation139a"></a><a href="#footnote139a"
class="citation">[139a]</a> he said that from that side of the
lake it did not appear, in very dry weather, to stand upon an
island; but that it was possible to go over to it without being
wet-shod.&nbsp; We were very lucky in seeing it after a great
flood; for its enchanting effect was chiefly owing to its
situation in the lake, a decayed palace rising out of the plain
of waters!&nbsp; I have called it a palace, for such feeling it
gave to me, though having been built as a place of defence, a
castle or fortress.&nbsp; We turned again and reascended the
hill, and sate a long time in the middle of it looking on the
castle and the huge mountain cove opposite, and William,
addressing himself to the ruin, poured out these
verses:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Child of loud-throated War! the mountain
stream<br />
Roars in thy hearing; but thy hour of rest<br />
Is come, and thou art silent in thy age. <a

class="citation">[139b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>We walked up the hill again, and, looking down the
vale, had a fine view of the lake and islands, resembling the
views down Windermere, though much less rich.&nbsp; Our walk to
Dalmally was pleasant: the vale makes a turn to the right, beyond
the head of the lake, and the village of Dalmally, which is, in
fact, only a few huts, the manse or minister&rsquo;s house, the
chapel, and the inn, stands near the river, which flows into the
head of the lake.&nbsp; The whole vale is very pleasing, the
lower part of the hill-sides being sprinkled with thatched
cottages, cultivated ground in small patches near them, which
evidently belonged to the cottages.</p>
<p>We were overtaken by a gentleman who rode on a beautiful white
pony, like Lilly, and was followed by his servant, a Highland
boy, on another pony, a little creature, not much bigger than a
large mastiff, on which were slung a pair of crutches and a
tartan plaid.&nbsp; The gentleman entered into conversation with
us, and on our telling him that we were going to Glen Coe, he
advised us, instead of proceeding directly to Tyndrum, the next
stage, to go round by the outlet of Loch Awe to Loch Etive, and
thence to Glen Coe.&nbsp; We were glad to change our plan, for we
wanted much to see more of Loch Awe, and he told us that the
whole of the way by Loch Etive was pleasant, and the road to
Tyndrum as dreary as possible; indeed, we could see it at that
time several miles before us upon the side of a bleak mountain;
and he said that there was nothing but moors and mountains all
the way.&nbsp; We reached the inn a little before sunset, ordered
supper, and I walked out.&nbsp; Crossed a bridge to look more
nearly at the parsonage-house and the chapel, which stands upon a
bank close to the river, a pretty stream overhung in some parts
by trees.&nbsp; <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>The vale is very pleasing; but, like
all the other Scotch vales we had yet seen, it told of its
kinship with the mountains and of poverty or some neglect on the
part of man.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>September</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;We had
been attended at supper by a civil boy, whom we engaged to rouse
us at six o&rsquo;clock, and to provide us each a basin of milk
and bread, and have the car ready; all which he did punctually,
and we were off in good time.&nbsp; The morning was not
unpleasant, though rather cold, and we had some fear of
rain.&nbsp; Crossed the bridge, and passed by the manse and
chapel, our road carrying us back again in the direction we had
come; but on the opposite side of the river.&nbsp; Passed close
to many of the houses we had seen on the hill-side, which the
lame gentleman had told us belonged to Lord Breadalbane, and were
attached to little farms, or &lsquo;crofts,&rsquo; as he called
them.&nbsp; Lord Breadalbane had lately laid out a part of his
estates in this way as an experiment, in the hope of preventing
discontent and emigration.&nbsp; We were sorry we had not an
opportunity of seeing into these cottages, and of learning how
far the people were happy or otherwise.&nbsp; The dwellings
certainly did not look so comfortable when we were near to them
as from a distance; but this might be chiefly owing to what the
inhabitants did not feel as an evil&mdash;the dirt about the
doors.&nbsp; We saw, however&mdash;a sight always painful to
me&mdash;two or three women, each creeping after her single cow,
while it was feeding on the slips of grass between the
corn-grounds.&nbsp; Went round the head of the lake, and onwards
close to the lake-side.&nbsp; Kilchurn Castle was always
interesting, though not so grand as seen from the other side,
with its own mountain cove and roaring stream.&nbsp; It combined
with the vale of Dalmally and the <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>distant
hills&mdash;a beautiful scene, yet overspread with a gentle
desolation.&nbsp; As we went further down we lost sight of the
vale of Dalmally.&nbsp; The castle, which we often stopped to
look back upon, was very beautiful seen in combination with the
opposite shore of the lake&mdash;perhaps a little bay, a tuft of
trees, or a slope of the hill.&nbsp; Travelled under the foot of
the mountain Cruachan, along an excellent road, having the lake
close to us on our left, woods overhead, and frequent torrents
tumbling down the hills.&nbsp; The distant views across the lake
were not peculiarly interesting after we were out of sight of
Kilchurn Castle, the lake being wide, and the opposite shore not
rich, and those mountains which we could see were not high.</p>
<p>Came opposite to the village where we had dined the day
before, and, losing sight of the body of the lake, pursued the
narrow channel or pass, <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a> which is, I
believe, three miles long, out of which issues the river that
flows into Loch Etive.&nbsp; We were now enclosed between steep
hills, on the opposite side entirely bare, on our side bare or
woody; the branch of the lake generally filling the whole area of
the vale.&nbsp; It was a pleasing, solitary scene; the long reach
of naked precipices on the other side rose directly out of the
water, exceedingly steep, not rugged or rocky, but with scanty
sheep pasturage and large beds of small stones, purple,
dove-coloured, or red, such as are called Screes in Cumberland
and Westmoreland.&nbsp; These beds, or rather streams of stones,
appeared as smooth as the turf itself, nay, I might say, as soft
as the feathers of birds, which they resembled in colour.&nbsp;
There was no building on either side of the water; in many parts
only just room for the road, and on the other shore no footing,
as it might <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>seem, for any creature larger than
the mountain sheep, and they, in treading amongst the shelving
stones, must often send them down into the lake below.</p>
<p>After we had wound for some time through the valley, having
met neither foot-traveller, horse, nor cart, we started at the
sight of a single vessel, just as it turned round the point of a
hill, coming into the reach of the valley where we were.&nbsp;
She floated steadily through the middle of the water, with one
large sail spread out, full swollen by the breeze, that blew her
right towards us.&nbsp; I cannot express what romantic images
this vessel brought along with her&mdash;how much more beautiful
the mountains appeared, the lake how much more graceful.&nbsp;
There was one man on board, who sate at the helm, and he, having
no companion, made the boat look more silent than if we could not
have seen him.&nbsp; I had almost said the ship, for on that
narrow water it appeared as large as the ships which I have
watched sailing out of a harbour of the sea.&nbsp; A little
further on we passed a stone hut by the lake-side, near which
were many charcoal sacks, and we conjectured that the vessel had
been depositing charcoal brought from other parts of Loch Awe to
be carried to the iron-works at Loch Etive.&nbsp; A little
further on we came to the end of the lake, but where exactly it
ended was not easy to determine, for the river was as broad as
the lake, and we could only say when it became positively a river
by the rushing of the water.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a grand stream,
the quantity of water being very large, frequently forming
rapids, and always flowing very quickly; but its greatness is
short-lived, for, after a course of three miles, it is lost in
the great waters of Loch Etive, a sea loch.</p>
<p>Crossed a bridge, and climbing a hill towards Taynuilt, <!--
page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>our baiting-place, we saw a hollow to the right below
us, through which the river continued its course between rocks
and steep banks of wood.&nbsp; William turned aside to look into
the dell, but I was too much tired.&nbsp; We had left it, two or
three hundred yards behind, an open river, the hills, enclosing
the branch of the lake, having settled down into irregular
slopes.&nbsp; We were glad when we reached Taynuilt, a village of
huts, with a chapel and one stone house, which was the inn.&nbsp;
It had begun to rain, and I was almost benumbed with the cold,
besides having a bad headache; so it rejoiced me to see kind
looks on the landlady&rsquo;s face, and that she was willing to
put herself in a bustle for our comfort; we had a good fire
presently, and breakfast was set out&mdash;eggs, preserved
gooseberries, excellent cream, cheese, and butter, but no wheat
bread, and the oaten cakes were so hard I could not chew
them.&nbsp; We wished to go upon Loch Etive; so, having desired
the landlady to prepare a fowl for supper, and engaged beds,
which she promised us willingly&mdash;a proof that we were not in
the great road&mdash;we determined to find our way to the lake
and endeavour to procure a boat.&nbsp; It rained heavily, but we
went on, hoping the sky would clear up.</p>
<p>Walked through unenclosed fields, a sort of half-desolate
country; but when we came to the mouth of the river which issues
out of Loch Awe, and which we had to cross by a ferry, looking up
that river we saw that the vale down which it flowed was richly
wooded and beautiful.</p>
<p>We were now among familiar fireside names.&nbsp; We could see
the town of Bunawe, a place of which the old woman with whom
William lodged ten years at Hawkshead used to tell tales half as
long as an ancient romance.&nbsp; It is a small village or port
on the same side of Loch Etive on <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>which we
stood, and at a little distance is a house built by a Mr. Knott
of Coniston Water-head, a partner in the iron-foundry at Bunawe,
in the service of whose family the old woman had spent her
youth.&nbsp; It was an ugly yellow-daubed building, staring this
way and that, but William looked at it with pleasure for poor Ann
Tyson&rsquo;s sake. <a name="citation145"></a><a
href="#footnote145" class="citation">[145]</a>&nbsp; We hailed
the ferry-boat, and a little boy came to fetch us; he rowed up
against the stream with all his might for a considerable way, and
then yielding to it, the boat was shot towards the shore almost
like an arrow from a bow.&nbsp; It was pleasing to observe the
dexterity with which the lad managed his oars, glorying in the
appearance of danger&mdash;for he observed us watching him, and
afterwards, while he conveyed us over, his pride redoubled; for
my part, I was completely dizzy with the swiftness of the
motion.</p>
<p>We could not have a boat from the ferry, but were told that if
we would walk to a house half a mile up the river, we had a
chance of getting one.&nbsp; I went a part of the way with
William, and then sate down under the umbrella near some
houses.&nbsp; A woman came out to talk with me, and pressed me to
take shelter in her house, which I refused, afraid of missing
William.&nbsp; She eyed me with extreme curiosity, asking fifty
questions respecting the object of our journey.&nbsp; She told me
that it rained most parts of the year there, and that there was
no chance of fine weather that day; and I believe when William
came to tell me that we could have a boat, she thought I was half
crazed.&nbsp; We went down to the shore of the lake, and, after
having sate some time under a wall, the boatman came to us, and
we went upon the water.&nbsp; At first it did not rain heavily,
and the air was not cold, and before we had gone far we rejoiced
that we had not been faint-hearted.&nbsp; The loch is of <!--
page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>a considerable width, but the mountains are so very
high that, whether we were close under them or looked from one
shore to the other, they maintained their dignity.&nbsp; I speak
of the higher part of the loch, above the town of Bunawe and the
large river, for downwards they are but hills, and the water
spreads out wide towards undetermined shores.&nbsp; On our right
was the mountain Cruachan, rising directly from the lake, and on
the opposite side another mountain, called Ben Durinish, craggy,
and exceedingly steep, with wild wood growing among the rocks and
stones.</p>
<p>We crossed the water, which was very rough in the middle, but
calmer near the shores, and some of the rocky basins and little
creeks among the rocks were as still as a mirror, and they were
so beautiful with the reflection of the orange-coloured seaweed
growing on the stones or rocks, that a child, with a
child&rsquo;s delight in gay colours, might have danced with joy
at the sight of them.&nbsp; It never ceased raining, and the tops
of the mountains were concealed by mists, but as long as we could
see across the water we were contented; for though little could
be seen of the true shapes and permanent appearances of the
mountains, we saw enough to give us the most exquisite delight:
the powerful lake which filled the large vale, roaring torrents,
clouds floating on the mountain sides, sheep that pastured there,
sea-birds and land birds.&nbsp; We sailed a considerable way
without coming to any houses or cultivated fields.&nbsp; There
was no horse-road on either side of the loch, but a person on
foot, as the boatman told us, might make his way at the foot of
Ben Durinish, namely on that side of the loch on which we were;
there was, however, not the least track to be seen, and it must
be very difficult and laborious.</p>
<p><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>We happened to say that we were going to Glen Coe,
which would be the journey of a long day and a half, when one of
the men, pointing to the head of the loch, replied that if we
were there we should be but an hour&rsquo;s walk from Glen
Coe.&nbsp; Though it continued raining, and there was no hope
that the rain would cease, we could not help wishing to go by
that way: it was an adventure; we were not afraid of trusting
ourselves to the hospitality of the Highlanders, and we wanted to
give our horse a day&rsquo;s rest, his back having been galled by
the saddle.&nbsp; The owner of the boat, who understood English
much better than the other man, his helper, said he would make
inquiries about the road at a farm-house a little further
on.&nbsp; He was very ready to talk with us, and was rather an
interesting companion; he spoke after a slow and solemn manner,
in book and sermon language and phrases:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A stately speech, such as grave livers do
in Scotland use.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we came to the farm-house of which the man had spoken,
William and he landed to make the necessary inquiries.&nbsp; It
was a thatched house at the foot of the high mountain Ben
Durinish&mdash;a few patches or little beds of corn belonging to
it; but the spot was pastoral, the green grass growing to the
walls of the house.&nbsp; The dwelling-house was distinguished
from the outer buildings, which were numerous, making it look
like two or three houses, as is common in Scotland, by a chimney
and one small window with sash-panes; on one side was a little
woody glen, with a precipitous stream that fell into the bay,
which was perfectly still, and bordered with the rich
orange-colour reflected from the sea-weed.&nbsp; Cruachan, on the
other side of the lake, was exceedingly grand, and appeared of an
<!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>enormous height, spreading out two large arms that made
a cove down which fell many streams swoln by the rain, and in the
hollow of the cove were some huts which looked like a
village.&nbsp; The top of the mountain was concealed from us by
clouds, and the mists floated high and low upon the sides of
it.</p>
<p>William came back to the boat highly pleased with the cheerful
hospitality and kindness of the woman of the house, who would
scarcely permit him and his guide to go away without taking some
refreshment.&nbsp; She was the only person at home, so they could
not obtain the desired information; but William had been well
repaid for the trouble of landing; indeed, rainy as it was, I
regretted that I had not landed also, for I should have wished to
bear away in my memory a perfect image of this place,&mdash;the
view from the doors, as well as the simple Highland comforts and
contrivances which were near it.&nbsp; I think I never saw a
retirement that would have so completely satisfied me, if I had
wanted to be altogether shut out from the world, and at the same
time among the grandest of the works of God; but it must be
remembered that mountains are often so much dignified by clouds,
mists, and other accidents of weather, that one could not know
them again in the full sunshine of a summer&rsquo;s noon.&nbsp;
But, whatever the mountains may be in their own shapes, the
farm-house with its pastoral grounds and corn fields won from the
mountain, its warm out-houses in irregular stages one above
another on the side of the hill, the rocks, the stream, and
sheltering bay, must at all times be interesting objects.&nbsp;
The household boat lay at anchor, chained to a rock, which, like
the whole border of the lake, was edged with sea-weed, and some
fishing-nets were hung upon poles,&mdash;affecting <!-- page
149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>images, which led our thoughts out to the wide ocean,
yet made these solitudes of the mountains bear the impression of
greater safety and more deep seclusion.</p>
<p>The rain became so heavy that we should certainly have turned
back if we had not felt more than usual courage from the pleasure
we had enjoyed, which raised hope where none was.&nbsp; There
were some houses a little higher up, and we determined to go
thither and make further inquiries.&nbsp; We could now hardly see
to the other side of the lake, yet continued to go on, and
presently heard some people pushing through a thicket close to
us, on which the boatman called out, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s one
that can tell us something about the road to Glen Coe, for he was
born there.&rsquo;&nbsp; We looked up and saw a ragged, lame
fellow, followed by some others, with a fishing-rod over his
shoulder; and he was making such good speed through the boughs
that one might have half believed he was the better for his lame
leg.&nbsp; He was the head of a company of tinkers, who, as the
men told us, travel with their fishing-rods as duly as their
hammers.&nbsp; On being hailed by us the whole company stopped;
and their lame leader and our boatmen shouted to each other in
Erse&mdash;a savage cry to our ears, in that lonely and romantic
place.&nbsp; We could not learn from the tinker all we wished to
know, therefore when we came near to the houses William landed
again with the owner of the boat.&nbsp; The rain was now so heavy
that we could see nothing at all&mdash;not even the houses
whither William was going.</p>
<p>We had given up all thought of proceeding further at that
time, but were desirous to know how far that road to Glen Coe was
practicable for us.&nbsp; They met with an intelligent man, who
was at work with others in a hay field, though it rained so
heavily; he gave them the information <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>they
desired, and said that there was an acquaintance of his between
that place and Glen Coe, who, he had no doubt, would gladly
accommodate us with lodging and anything else we might
need.&nbsp; When William returned to the boat we shaped our
course back again down the water, leaving the head of Loch Etive
not only unvisited, but unseen&mdash;to our great regret.&nbsp;
The rain was very heavy; the wind had risen, and both wind and
tide were against us, so that it was hard labour for the boatmen
to push us on.&nbsp; They kept as close to the shore as they
could, to be under the wind; but at the doubling of many of the
rocky points the tide was so strong that it was difficult to get
on at all, and I was sometimes afraid that we should be dashed
against the rocks, though I believe, indeed, there was not much
danger.</p>
<p>Came down the same side of the lake under Ben Durinish, and
landed at a ferry-house opposite to Bunawe, where we gave the men
a glass of whisky; but our chief motive for landing was to look
about the place, which had a most wild aspect at that time.&nbsp;
It was a low promontory, pushed far into the water, narrowing the
lake exceedingly; in the obscurity occasioned by the mist and
rain it appeared to be an island; it was stained and
weather-beaten, a rocky place, seeming to bear no produce but
such as might be cherished by cold and storms, lichens or the
incrustations of sea rocks.&nbsp; We rowed right across the water
to the mouth of the river of Loch Awe, our boat following the
ferry-boat which was conveying the tinker crew to the other side,
whither they were going to lodge, as the men told us, in some
kiln, which they considered as their right and privilege&mdash;a
lodging always to be found where there was any arable
land&mdash;for every farm has its kiln to dry the <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>corn in: another proof of the wetness of the
climate.&nbsp; The kilns are built of stone, covered in, and
probably as good a shelter as the huts in which these Highland
vagrants were born.&nbsp; They gather sticks or heather for their
fire, and, as they are obstinate beggars, for the men said they
would not be denied, they probably have plenty of food with
little other trouble than that of wandering in search of it, for
their smutty faces and tinker equipage serve chiefly for a
passport to a free and careless life.&nbsp; It rained very
heavily, and the wind blew when we crossed the lake, and their
boat and ours went tilting over the high waves.&nbsp; They made a
romantic appearance; three women were of the party; two men rowed
them over; the lame fellow sate at one end of the boat, and his
companion at the other, each with an enormous fishing-rod, which
looked very graceful, something like masts to the boat.&nbsp;
When we had landed at the other side we saw them, after having
begged at the ferry-house, strike merrily through the fields, no
doubt betaking themselves to their shelter for the night.</p>
<p>We were completely wet when we reached the inn; the landlady
wanted to make a fire for me up-stairs, but I went into her own
parlour to undress, and her daughter, a pretty little girl, who
could speak a few words of English, waited on me; I rewarded her
with one of the penny books bought at Dumfries for Johnny, with
which she was greatly delighted.&nbsp; We had an excellent
supper&mdash;fresh salmon, a fowl, gooseberries and cream, and
potatoes; good beds; and the next morning boiled milk and bread,
and were only charged seven shillings and sixpence for the
whole&mdash;horse, liquor, supper, and the two breakfasts.&nbsp;
We thought they had made a mistake, and told them so&mdash;for it
was only just half as much as we had paid the day <!-- page
152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>before at Dalmally, the case being that Dalmally is in
the main road of the tourists.&nbsp; The landlady insisted on my
bringing away a little cup instead of our tin can, which she told
me had been taken from the car by some children: we set no little
value on this cup as a memorial of the good woman&rsquo;s honesty
and kindness, and hoped to have brought it home. . . .</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>September</i> 2<i>d</i>.&mdash;Departed at
about seven o&rsquo;clock this morning, having to travel eight
miles down Loch Etive, and then to cross a ferry.&nbsp; Our road
was at first at a considerable distance from the lake, and out of
sight of it, among undulating hills covered with coppice woods,
resembling the country between Coniston and Windermere, but it
afterwards carried us close to the water&rsquo;s edge; and in
this part of our ride we were disappointed.&nbsp; We knew that
the high mountains were all at the head of the lake, therefore
had not expected the same awful grandeur which we beheld the day
before, and perceived by glimpses; but the gentleman whom we met
with at Dalmally had told us that there were many fine situations
for gentlemen&rsquo;s seats on this part of the lake, which had
made us expect greater loveliness near the shores, and better
cultivation.&nbsp; It is true there are pleasant bays, with
grounds prettily sloping to the water, and coppice woods, where
houses would stand in shelter and sun, looking on the lake; but
much is yet wanting&mdash;waste lands to be ploughed, peat-mosses
drained, hedgerows reared; and the woods demand a grant of longer
life than is now their privilege.</p>
<p>But after we had journeyed about six miles a beautiful scene
opened upon us.&nbsp; The morning had been gloomy, and at this
time the sun shone out, scattering the clouds.&nbsp; <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>We
looked right down the lake, that was covered with streams of
dazzling sunshine, which revealed the indentings of the dark
shores.&nbsp; On a bold promontory, on the same side of the loch
where we were, stood an old castle, an irregular tall building,
not without majesty; and beyond, with leagues of water between,
our eyes settled upon the island of Mull, a high mountain, green
in the sunshine, and overcast with clouds,&mdash;an object as
inviting to the fancy as the evening sky in the west, and though
of a terrestrial green, almost as visionary.&nbsp; We saw that it
was an island of the seas but were unacquainted with its name; it
was of a gem-like colour, and as soft as the sky.&nbsp; The
shores of Loch Etive, in their moorish, rocky wildness, their
earthly bareness, as they lay in length before us, produced a
contrast which, with the pure sea, the brilliant sunshine, the
long distance, contributed to the a&euml;rial and romantic power
with which the mountain island was invested.</p>
<p>Soon after, we came to the ferry.&nbsp; The boat being on the
other shore, we had to wait a considerable time, though the water
was not wide, and our call was heard immediately.&nbsp; The
boatmen moved with surly tardiness, as if glad to make us know
that they were our masters.&nbsp; At this point the lake was
narrowed to the breadth of not a very wide river by a round ear
or promontory on the side on which we were, and a low ridge of
peat-mossy ground on the other.&nbsp; It was a dreary place, shut
out from the beautiful prospect of the Isle of Mull, and
Dunstaffnage Castle&mdash;so the fortress was called.&nbsp; Four
or five men came over with the boat; the horse was unyoked, and
being harshly driven over rough stones, which were as slippery as
ice, with slimy seaweed, he was in terror before he reached the
boat, and they completed the work by beating and pushing him by
<!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>main force over the ridge of the boat, for there was no
open end, or plank, or any other convenience for shipping either
horse or carriage.&nbsp; I was very uneasy when we were launched
on the water.&nbsp; A blackguard-looking fellow, blind of one
eye, which I could not but think had been put out in some strife
or other, held him by force like a horse-breaker, while the poor
creature fretted, and stamped with his feet against the bare
boards, frightening himself more and more with every stroke; and
when we were in the middle of the water I would have given a
thousand pounds to have been sure that we should reach the other
side in safety.&nbsp; The tide was rushing violently in, making a
strong eddy with the stream of the loch, so that the motion of
the boat and the noise and foam of the waves terrified him still
more, and we thought it would be impossible to keep him in the
boat, and when we were just far enough from the shore to have
been all drowned he became furious, and, plunging desperately,
his hind-legs were in the water, then, recovering himself, he
beat with such force against the boat-side that we were afraid he
should send his feet through.&nbsp; All the while the men were
swearing terrible oaths, and cursing the poor beast, redoubling
their curses when we reached the landing-place, and whipping him
ashore in brutal triumph.</p>
<p>We had only room for half a heartful of joy when we set foot
on dry land, for another ferry was to be crossed five miles
further.&nbsp; We had intended breakfasting at this house if it
had been a decent place; but after this affair we were glad to
pay the men off and depart, though I was not well and needed
refreshment.&nbsp; The people made us more easy by assuring us
that we might easily swim the horse over the next ferry.&nbsp;
The first mile or two of our <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>road was
over a peat-moss; we then came near to the seashore, and had
beautiful views backwards towards the Island of Mull and
Dunstaffnage Castle, and forward where the sea ran up between the
hills.&nbsp; In this part, on the opposite side of the small bay
or elbow of the sea, was a gentleman&rsquo;s house on a hillside,
<a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a> and a building on the hill-top which
we took for a lighthouse, but were told that it belonged to the
mansion, and was only lighted up on rejoicing days&mdash;the
laird&rsquo;s birthday, for instance.</p>
<p>Before we had left the peat-moss to travel close to the
sea-shore we delighted ourselves with looking on a range of green
hills, in shape like those bordering immediately upon the sea,
abrupt but not high; they were, in fact, a continuation of the
same; but retiring backwards, and rising from the black
peat-moss.&nbsp; These hills were of a delicate green, uncommon
in Scotland; a foaming rivulet ran down one part, and near it lay
two herdsmen full in the sun, with their dogs, among a troop of
black cattle which were feeding near, and sprinkled over the
whole range of hills&mdash;a pastoral scene, to our eyes the more
beautiful from knowing what a delightful prospect it must
overlook.&nbsp; We now came under the steeps by the sea-side,
which were bold rocks, mouldering scars, or fresh with green
grass.&nbsp; Under the brow of one of these rocks was a
burying-ground, with many upright grave-stones and hay-cocks
between, and fenced round by a wall neatly sodded.&nbsp; Near it
were one or two houses, with out-houses under a group of trees,
but no chapel.&nbsp; The neatness of the burying-ground would in
itself have been noticeable in any part of Scotland where we have
been; but it was more interesting from its situation than for its
own sake&mdash;within the sound of the gentlest <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>waves of the sea, and near so many quiet and beautiful
objects.&nbsp; There was a range of hills opposite, which we were
here first told were the hills of Morven, so much sung of by
Ossian.&nbsp; We consulted with some men respecting the ferry,
who advised us by all means to send our horse round the loch, and
go ourselves over in the boat: they were very civil, and seemed
to be intelligent men, yet all disagreed about the length of the
loch, though we were not two miles from it: one said it was only
six miles long, another ten or fifteen, and afterwards a man whom
we met told us it was twenty.</p>
<p>We lost sight of the sea for some time, crossing a
half-cultivated space, then reached Loch Creran, a large
irregular sea loch, with low sloping banks, coppice woods, and
uncultivated grounds, with a scattering of corn fields; as it
appeared to us, very thinly inhabited: mountains at a
distance.&nbsp; We found only women at home at the
ferry-house.&nbsp; I was faint and cold, and went to sit by the
fire, but, though very much needing refreshment, I had not heart
to eat anything there&mdash;the house was so dirty, and there
were so many wretchedly dirty women and children; yet perhaps I
might have got over the dirt, though I believe there are few
ladies who would not have been turned sick by it, if there had
not been a most disgusting combination of laziness and coarseness
in the countenances and manners of the women, though two of them
were very handsome.&nbsp; It was a small hut, and four women were
living in it: one, the mother of the children and mistress of the
house; the others I supposed to be lodgers, or perhaps servants;
but there was no work amongst them.&nbsp; They had just taken
from the fire a great pan full of potatoes, which they mixed up
with milk, all helping <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>themselves
out of the same vessel, and the little children put in their
dirty hands to dig out of the mess at their pleasure.&nbsp; I
thought to myself, How light the labour of such a house as
this!&nbsp; Little sweeping, no washing of floors, and as to
scouring the table, I believe it was a thing never thought
of.</p>
<p>After a long time the ferryman came home; but we had to wait
yet another hour for the tide.&nbsp; In the meanwhile our horse
took fright in consequence of his terror at the last ferry, ran
away with the car, and dashed out umbrellas, greatcoats, etc.;
but luckily he was stopped before any serious mischief was
done.&nbsp; We had determined, whatever it cost, not to trust
ourselves with him again in the boat; but sending him round the
lake seemed almost out of the question, there being no road, and
probably much difficulty in going round with a horse; so after
some deliberation with the ferryman it was agreed that he should
swim over.&nbsp; The usual place of ferrying was very broad, but
he was led to the point of a peninsula at a little
distance.&nbsp; It being an unusual affair,&mdash;indeed, the
people of the house said that he was the first horse that had
ever swum over,&mdash;we had several men on board, and the
mistress of the house offered herself as an assistant: we
supposed for the sake of a share in eighteen-pennyworth of whisky
which her husband called for without ceremony, and of which she
and the young lasses, who had helped to push the boat into the
water, partook as freely as the men.&nbsp; At first I feared for
the horse: he was frightened, and strove to push himself under
the boat; but I was soon tolerably easy, for he went on regularly
and well, and after from six to ten minutes swimming landed in
safety on the other side.&nbsp; Poor creature! he stretched out
his nostrils and stared <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>wildly
while the man was trotting him about to warm him, and when he put
him into the car he was afraid of the sound of the wheels.&nbsp;
For some time our road was up a glen, the banks chiefly covered
with coppice woods, an unpeopled, but, though without grandeur,
not a dreary tract.</p>
<p>Came to a moor and descended into a broad vale, which opened
to Loch Linnhe, an arm of the sea, the prospect being shut in by
high mountains, on which the sun was shining among mists and
resting clouds.&nbsp; A village and chapel stood on the opposite
hill; the hills sloped prettily down to the bed of the vale, a
large level area&mdash;the grounds in general cultivated, but not
rich.&nbsp; We went perhaps half a mile down the vale, when our
road struck right across it towards the village on the
hill-side.&nbsp; We overtook a tall, well-looking man, seemingly
about thirty years of age, driving a cart, of whom we inquired
concerning the road, and the distance to Portnacroish, our
baiting-place.&nbsp; We made further inquiries respecting our
future journey, which he answered in an intelligent manner, being
perfectly acquainted with the geography of Scotland.&nbsp; He
told us that the village which we saw before us and the whole
tract of country was called Appin.&nbsp; William said that it was
a pretty wild place, to which the man replied, &lsquo;Sir, it is
a very bonny place if you did but see it on a fine day,&rsquo;
mistaking William&rsquo;s praise for a half-censure; I must say,
however, that we hardly ever saw a thoroughly pleasing place in
Scotland, which had not something of wildness in its aspect of
one sort or other.&nbsp; It came from many causes here: the sea,
or sea-loch, of which we only saw as it were a glimpse crossing
the vale at the foot of it, the high mountains on the opposite
shore, the unenclosed hills on <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>each side
of the vale, with black cattle feeding on them, the simplicity of
the scattered huts, the half-sheltered, half-exposed situation of
the village, the imperfect culture of the fields, the distance
from any city or large town, and the very names of Morven and
Appin, particularly at such a time, when old Ossian&rsquo;s old
friends, sunbeams and mists, as like ghosts as any in the
mid-afternoon could be, were keeping company with them.&nbsp;
William did all he could to efface the unpleasant impression he
had made on the Highlander, and not without success, for he was
kind and communicative when we walked up the hill towards the
village.&nbsp; He had been a great traveller, in Ireland and
elsewhere; but I believe that he had visited no place so
beautiful to his eyes as his native home, the strath of Appin
under the heathy hills.</p>
<p>We arrived at Portnacroish soon after parting from this
man.&nbsp; It is a small village&mdash;a few huts and an
indifferent inn by the side of the loch.&nbsp; Ordered a fowl for
dinner, had a fire lighted, and went a few steps from the door up
the road, and turning aside into a field stood at the top of a
low eminence, from which, looking down the loch to the sea
through a long vista of hills and mountains, we beheld one of the
most delightful prospects that, even when we dream of fairer
worlds than this, it is possible for us to conceive in our
hearts.&nbsp; A covering of clouds rested on the long range of
the hills of Morven, mists floated very near to the water on
their sides, and were slowly shifting about: yet the sky was
clear, and the sea, from the reflection of the sky, of an
ethereal or sapphire blue, which was intermingled in many places,
and mostly by gentle gradations, with beds of bright dazzling
sunshine; green islands lay on the calm water, islands far <!--
page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>greener, for so it seemed, than the grass of other
places; and from their excessive beauty, their unearthly
softness, and the great distance of many of them, they made us
think of the islands of the blessed in the Vision of
Mirza&mdash;a resemblance more striking from the long tract of
mist which rested on the top of the steeps of Morven.&nbsp; The
view was endless, and though not so wide, had something of the
intricacy of the islands and water of Loch Lomond as we saw them
from Inch-ta-vanach; and yet how different!&nbsp; At Loch Lomond
we could never forget that it was an inland lake of fresh water,
nor here that it was the sea itself, though among multitudes of
hills.&nbsp; Immediately below us, on an island a few yards from
the shore, stood an old keep or fortress; <a
name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160"
class="citation">[160]</a> the vale of Appin opened to the
water-side, with cultivated fields and cottages.&nbsp; If there
were trees near the shore they contributed little to the
delightful effect of the scene: it was the immeasurable water,
the lofty mist-covered steeps of Morven to the right, the emerald
islands without a bush or tree, the celestial colour and
brightness of the calm sea, and the innumerable creeks and bays,
the communion of land and water as far as the eye could
travel.&nbsp; My description must needs be languid; for the sight
itself was too fair to be remembered.&nbsp; We sate a long time
upon the hill, and pursued our journey at about four
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Had an indifferent dinner, but the cheese
was so excellent that William wished to buy the remainder; but
the woman would not consent to sell it, and forced us to accept a
large portion of it.</p>
<p>We had to travel up the loch, leaving behind us the beautiful
scene which we had viewed with such delight before dinner.&nbsp;
Often, while we were climbing the hill, did <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>we stop to
look back, and when we had gone twenty or thirty yards beyond the
point where we had the last view of it, we left the car to the
care of some children who were coming from school, and went to
take another farewell, always in the hope of bearing away a more
substantial remembrance.&nbsp; Travelled for some miles along a
road which was so smooth it was more like a gravel walk in a
gentleman&rsquo;s grounds than a public highway.&nbsp; Probably
the country is indebted for this excellent road to Lord
Tweeddale, <a name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a> now a prisoner in France.&nbsp; His
house stands upon an eminence within a mile of Portnacroish,
commanding the same prospect which I have spoken of, except that
it must lose something in not having the old fortress at the foot
of it&mdash;indeed, it is not to be seen at all from the house or
grounds.</p>
<p>We travelled under steep hills, stony or smooth, with
coppice-woods and patches of cultivated land, and houses here and
there; and at every hundred yards, I may almost venture to say, a
streamlet, narrow as a ribbon, came tumbling down, and, crossing
our road, fell into the lake below.&nbsp; On the opposite shore,
the hills&mdash;namely, the continuation of the hills of
Morven&mdash;were stern and severe, rising like upright walls
from the water&rsquo;s edge, and in colour more resembling rocks
than hills, as they appeared to us.&nbsp; We did not see any
house, or any place where it was likely a house could stand, for
many miles; but as the loch was broad we could not perhaps
distinguish the objects thoroughly.&nbsp; A little after sunset
our road led us from the vale of the loch.&nbsp; We came to a
small river, a bridge, a mill, and some cottages at the foot of a
hill, and close to the loch.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Did not cross the bridge, but went up the brook, having
it on our left, and soon found ourselves in a retired valley,
scattered over with many grey huts, and surrounded on every side
by green hills.&nbsp; The hay grounds in the middle of the vale
were unenclosed, which was enough to keep alive the Scottish
wildness, here blended with exceeding beauty; for there were
trees growing irregularly or in clumps all through the valley,
rocks or stones here and there, which, with the people at work,
hay-cocks sprinkled over the fields, made the vale look full and
populous.&nbsp; It was a sweet time of the evening: the moon was
up; but there was yet so much of day that her light was not
perceived.&nbsp; Our road was through open fields; the people
suspended their work as we passed along, and leaning on their
pitchforks or rakes, with their arms at their sides, or hanging
down, some in one way, some in another, and no two alike, they
formed most beautiful groups, the outlines of their figures being
much more distinct than by day, and all that might have been
harsh or unlovely softened down.&nbsp; The dogs were, as usual,
attendant on their masters, and, watching after us, they barked
aloud; yet even their barking hardly disturbed the quiet of the
place.</p>
<p>I cannot say how long this vale was; it made the larger half
of a circle, or a curve deeper than that of half a circle, before
it opened again upon the loch.&nbsp; It was less thoroughly
cultivated and woody after the last turning&mdash;the hills steep
and lofty.&nbsp; We met a very tall stout man, a fine figure, in
a Highland bonnet, with a little girl, driving home their cow: he
accosted us, saying that we were late travellers, and that we had
yet four miles to go before we should reach Ballachulish&mdash;a
long way, uncertain as we were respecting our
accommodations.&nbsp; <!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>He told us that the vale was called
the Strath of Duror, and when we said it was a pretty place, he
answered, Indeed it was, and that they lived very comfortably
there, for they had a good master, Lord Tweeddale, whose
imprisonment he lamented, speaking earnestly of his excellent
qualities.&nbsp; At the end of the vale we came close upon a
large bay of the loch, formed by a rocky hill, a continuation of
the ridge of high hills on the left side of the strath, making a
very grand promontory, under which was a hamlet, a cluster of
huts, at the water&rsquo;s edge, with their little fleet of
fishing boats at anchor, and behind, among the rocks, a hundred
slips of corn, slips and patches, often no bigger than a garden
such as a child, eight years old, would make for sport: it might
have been the work of a small colony from China.&nbsp; There was
something touching to the heart in this appearance of scrupulous
industry, and excessive labour of the soil, in a country where
hills and mountains, and even valleys, are left to the care of
nature and the pleasure of the cattle that feed among them.&nbsp;
It was, indeed, a very interesting place, the more so being in
perfect contrast with the few houses at the entrance of the
strath&mdash;a sea hamlet, without trees, under a naked stony
mountain, yet perfectly sheltered, standing in the middle of a
large bay which half the winds that travel over the lake can
never visit.&nbsp; The other, a little bowery spot, with its
river, bridge, and mill, might have been a hundred miles from the
sea-side.</p>
<p>The moon was now shining, and though it reminded us how far
the evening was advanced, we stopped for many minutes before we
could resolve to go on; we saw nothing stirring, neither men,
women, nor cattle; but the linen was still bleaching by the stony
rivulet, which ran near the houses in water-breaks and tiny
cataracts.&nbsp; For the <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>first half
mile after we had left this scene there was no thing remarkable;
and afterwards we could only see the hills, the sky, the moon,
and moonlight water.&nbsp; When we came within, it might be, half
a mile of Ballachulish, the place where we were to lodge, the
loch narrowed very much, the hills still continuing high.&nbsp; I
speak inaccurately, for it split into two divisions, the one
along which we went being called Loch Leven.</p>
<p>The road grew very bad, and we had an anxious journey till we
saw a light before us, which with great joy we assured ourselves
was from the inn; but what was our distress when, on going a few
steps further, we came to a bridge half broken down, with bushes
laid across to prevent travellers from going over.&nbsp; After
some perplexity we determined that I should walk on to the house
before us&mdash;for we could see that the bridge was safe for
foot-passengers&mdash;and ask for assistance.&nbsp; By great good
luck, at this very moment four or five men came along the road
towards us and offered to help William in driving the car through
the water, which was not very deep at that time, though, only a
few days before, the damage had been done to the bridge by a
flood.</p>
<p>I walked on to the inn, ordered tea, and was conducted into a
lodging room.&nbsp; I desired to have a fire, and was answered
with the old scruple about &lsquo;giving fire,&rsquo;&mdash;with,
at the same time, an excuse &lsquo;that it was so
late,&rsquo;&mdash;the girl, however, would ask the landlady, who
was lying-in; the fire was brought immediately, and from that
time the girl was very civil.&nbsp; I was not, however, quite at
ease, for William stayed long, and I was going to leave my fire
to seek after him, when I heard him at the door with the horse
and car.&nbsp; The horse had taken fright with the roughness of
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>the river-bed and the rattling of the wheels&mdash;the
second fright in consequence of the ferry&mdash;and the men had
been obliged to unyoke him and drag the car through, a
troublesome affair for William; but he talked less of the trouble
and alarm than of the pleasure he had felt in having met with
such true good-will and ready kindness in the Highlanders.&nbsp;
They drank their glass of whisky at the door, wishing William
twenty good wishes, and asking him twice as many
questions,&mdash;if he was married, if he had an estate, where he
lived, etc. etc.&nbsp; This inn is the ferry-house on the main
road up into the Highlands by Fort-William, and here Coleridge,
though unknown to us, had slept three nights before. <a

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>September</i> 3<i>d</i>.&mdash;When we
have arrived at an unknown place by moonlight, it is never a
moment of indifference when I quit it again with the morning
light, especially if the objects have appeared beautiful, or in
any other way impressive or interesting.&nbsp; I have kept back,
unwilling to go to the window, that I might not lose the picture
taken to my pillow at night.&nbsp; So it was at Ballachulish: and
instantly I felt that the passing away of my own fancies was a
loss.&nbsp; The place had appeared exceedingly wild by moonlight;
I had mistaken corn-fields for naked rocks, and the lake had
appeared narrower and the hills more steep and lofty than they
really were.</p>
<p>We rose at six o&rsquo;clock, and took a basin of milk before
we set forward on our journey to Glen Coe.&nbsp; It was a
delightful morning, the road excellent, and we were in good
spirits, happy that we had no more ferries to cross, and pleased
with the thought that we were going among the grand mountains
which we saw before us at the head of <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>the
loch.&nbsp; We travelled close to the water&rsquo;s edge, and
were rolling along a smooth road, when the horse suddenly backed,
frightened by the upright shafts of a roller rising from behind
the wall of a field adjoining the road.&nbsp; William pulled,
whipped, and struggled in vain; we both leapt upon the ground,
and the horse dragged the car after him, he going backwards down
the bank of the loch, and it was turned over, half in the water,
the horse lying on his back, struggling in the harness, a
frightful sight!&nbsp; I gave up everything; thought that the
horse would be lamed, and the car broken to pieces.&nbsp; Luckily
a man came up in the same moment, and assisted William in
extricating the horse, and, after an hour&rsquo;s delay, with the
help of strings and pocket-handkerchiefs, we mended the harness
and set forward again, William leading the poor animal all the
way, for the regular beating of the waves frightened him, and any
little gushing stream that crossed the road would have sent him
off.&nbsp; The village where the blacksmith lived was before
us&mdash;a few huts under the mountains, and, as it seemed, at
the head of the loch; but it runs further up to the left, being
narrowed by a hill above the village, near which, at the edge of
the water, was a slate quarry, and many large boats with masts,
on the water below, high mountains shutting in the prospect,
which stood in single, distinguishable shapes, yet clustered
together&mdash;simple and bold in their forms, and their surfaces
of all characters and all colours&mdash;some that looked as if
scarified by fire, others green; and there was one that might
have been blasted by an eternal frost, its summit and sides for a
considerable way down being as white as hoar-frost at eight
o&rsquo;clock on a winter&rsquo;s morning.&nbsp; No clouds were
on the hills; the sun shone bright, but the wind blew fresh and
cold.</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>When we reached the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, I left
William to help to take care of the horse, and went into the
house.&nbsp; The mistress, with a child in her arms and two or
three running about, received me very kindly, making many
apologies for the dirty house, which she partly attributed to its
being Saturday; but I could plainly see that it was dirt of all
days.&nbsp; I sate in the midst of it with great delight, for the
woman&rsquo;s benevolent, happy countenance almost converted her
slovenly and lazy way of leaving all things to take care of
themselves into a comfort and a blessing.</p>
<p>It was not a Highland hut, but a slated house built by the
master of the quarry for the accommodation of his
blacksmith,&mdash;the shell of an English cottage, as if left
unfinished by the workmen, without plaster, and with floor of
mud.&nbsp; Two beds, with not over-clean bedclothes, were in the
room.&nbsp; Luckily for me, there was a good fire and a boiling
kettle.&nbsp; The woman was very sorry she had no butter; none
was to be had in the village: she gave me oaten and barley
bread.&nbsp; We talked over the fire; I answered her hundred
questions, and in my turn put some to her.&nbsp; She asked me, as
usual, if I was married, how many brothers I had, etc. etc.&nbsp;
I told her that William was married, and had a fine boy; to which
she replied, &lsquo;And the man&rsquo;s a decent man
too.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her next-door neighbour came in with a baby on
her arm, to request that I would accept of some fish, which I
broiled in the ashes.&nbsp; She joined in our conversation, but
with more shyness than her neighbour, being a very young
woman.&nbsp; She happened to say that she was a stranger in that
place, and had been bred and born a long way off.&nbsp; On my
asking her where, she replied, &lsquo;At Leadhills;&rsquo; and
when I told <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>her that I had been there, a joy
lighted up her countenance which I shall never forget, and when
she heard that it was only a fortnight before, her eyes filled
with tears.&nbsp; I was exceedingly affected with the simplicity
of her manners; her tongue was now let loose, and she would have
talked for ever of Leadhills, of her mother, of the quietness of
the people in general, and the goodness of Mrs. Otto, who, she
told me, was a &lsquo;varra discreet woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was
sure we should be &lsquo;well put up&rsquo; at Mrs. Otto&rsquo;s,
and praised her house and furniture; indeed, it seemed she
thought all earthly comforts were gathered together under the
bleak heights that surround the villages of Wanlockhead and
Leadhills: and afterwards, when I said it was a wild country
thereabouts, she even seemed surprised, and said it was not half
so wild as where she lived now.&nbsp; One circumstance which she
mentioned of Mrs. Otto I must record, both in proof of her
&lsquo;discretion,&rsquo; and the sobriety of the people at
Leadhills, namely, that no liquor was ever drunk in her house
after a certain hour of the night&mdash;I have forgotten what
hour; but it was an early one, I am sure not later than ten.</p>
<p>The blacksmith, who had come in to his breakfast, was
impatient to finish our job, that he might go out into the
hay-field, for, it being a fine day, every plot of hay-ground was
scattered over with hay-makers.&nbsp; On my saying that I guessed
much of their hay must be spoiled, he told me no, for that they
had high winds, which dried it quickly,&mdash;the people
understood the climate, &lsquo;were clever at the work, and got
it in with a blink.&rsquo;&nbsp; He hastily swallowed his
breakfast, dry bread and a basin of weak tea without sugar, and
held his baby on his knee till he had done.</p>
<p><!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>The women and I were again left to the fireside, and
there were no limits to their joy in me, for they discovered
another bond of connexion.&nbsp; I lived in the same part of
England from which Mr. Rose, the superintendent of the
slate-quarries, and his wife, had come.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;
said Mrs. Stuart&mdash;so her neighbour called her, they not
giving each other their Christian names, as is common in
Cumberland and Westmoreland,&mdash;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;what would not I give to see anybody that came from within
four or five miles of Leadhills?&rsquo;&nbsp; They both exclaimed
that I must see Mrs. Rose; she would make much of me&mdash;she
would have given me tea and bread and butter and a good
breakfast.&nbsp; I learned from the two women, Mrs. Stuart and
Mrs. Duncan&mdash;so the other was called&mdash;that Stuart had
come from Leadhills for the sake of better wages, to take the
place of Duncan, who had resigned his office of blacksmith to the
quarries, as far as I could learn, in a pet, intending to go to
America, that his wife was averse to go, and that the scheme, for
this cause and through other difficulties, had been given
up.&nbsp; He appeared to be a good-tempered man, and made us a
most reasonable charge for mending the car.&nbsp; His wife told
me that they must give up the house in a short time to the other
blacksmith; she did not know whither they should go, but her
husband, being a good workman, could find employment
anywhere.&nbsp; She hurried me out to introduce me to Mrs. Rose,
who was at work in the hay-field; she was exceedingly glad to see
one of her country-women, and entreated that I would go up to her
house.&nbsp; It was a substantial plain house, that would have
held half-a-dozen of the common huts.&nbsp; She conducted me into
a sitting-room up-stairs, and set before me red and white wine,
with the remnant of a loaf of wheaten bread, <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>which she
took out of a cupboard in the sitting-room, and some delicious
butter.&nbsp; She was a healthy and cheerful-looking woman,
dressed like one of our country lasses, and had certainly had no
better education than Aggy Ashburner, but she was as a chief in
this secluded place, a Madam of the village, and seemed to be
treated with the utmost respect.</p>
<p>In our way to and from the house we met several people who
interchanged friendly greetings with her, but always as with one
greatly superior.&nbsp; She attended me back to the
blacksmith&rsquo;s, and would not leave me till she had seen us
set forward again on our journey.&nbsp; Mrs. Duncan and Mrs.
Stuart shook me cordially, nay, affectionately, by the
hand.&nbsp; I tried to prevail upon the former, who had been my
hostess, to accept of some money, but in vain; she would not take
a farthing, and though I told her it was only to buy something
for her little daughter, even seemed grieved that I should think
it possible.&nbsp; I forgot to mention that while the blacksmith
was repairing the car, we walked to the slate-quarry, where we
saw again some of the kind creatures who had helped us in our
difficulties the night before.&nbsp; The hovel under which they
split their slates stood upon an out-jutting rock, a part of the
quarry rising immediately out of the water, and commanded a fine
prospect down the loch below Ballachulish, and upwards towards
the grand mountains, and the other horn of the vale where the
lake was concealed.&nbsp; The blacksmith drove our car about a
mile of the road; we then hired a man and horse to take me and
the car to the top of Glen Coe, being afraid that if the horse
backed or took fright we might be thrown down some precipice.</p>
<p>But before we departed we could not resist our <!-- page
171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>inclination to climb up the hill which I have mentioned
as appearing to terminate the loch.&nbsp; The mountains, though
inferior to those of Glen Coe, on the other side are very
majestic; and the solitude in which we knew the unseen lake was
bedded at their feet was enough to excite our longings.&nbsp; We
climbed steep after steep, far higher than they appeared to us,
and I was going to give up the accomplishment of our aim, when a
glorious sight on the mountain before us made me forget my
fatigue.&nbsp; A slight shower had come on, its skirts falling
upon us, and half the opposite side of the mountain was wrapped
up in rainbow light, covered as by a veil with one dilated
rainbow: so it continued for some minutes; and the shower and
rainy clouds passed away as suddenly as they had come, and the
sun shone again upon the tops of all the hills.&nbsp; In the
meantime we reached the wished-for point, and saw to the head of
the loch.&nbsp; Perhaps it might not be so beautiful as we had
imaged it in our thoughts, but it was beautiful enough not to
disappoint us,&mdash;a narrow deep valley, a perfect solitude,
without house or hut.&nbsp; One of the hills was thinly sprinkled
with Scotch firs, which appeared to be the survivors of a large
forest: they were the first natural wild Scotch firs we had
seen.&nbsp; Though thinned of their numbers, and left,
comparatively, to a helpless struggle with the elements, we were
much struck with the gloom, and even grandeur, of the trees.</p>
<p>Hastened back again to join the car, but were tempted to go a
little out of our way to look at a nice white house belonging to
the laird of Glen Coe, which stood sweetly in a green field under
the hill near some tall trees and coppice woods.&nbsp; At this
house the horrible massacre of Glen Coe began, which we did not
know when we were there; but <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>the house
must have been rebuilt since that time.&nbsp; We had a delightful
walk through fields, among copses, and by a river-side: we could
have fancied ourselves in some part of the north of England
unseen before, it was so much like it, and yet so
different.&nbsp; I must not forget one place on the opposite side
of the water, where we longed to live&mdash;a snug white house on
the mountain-side, surrounded by its own green fields and woods,
the high mountain above, the loch below, and inaccessible but by
means of boats.&nbsp; A beautiful spot indeed it was; but in the
retired parts of Scotland a comfortable white house is itself
such a pleasant sight, that I believe, without our knowing how or
why, it makes us look with a more loving eye on the fields and
trees than for their own sakes they deserve.</p>
<p>At about one o&rsquo;clock we set off, William on our own
horse, and I with my Highland driver.&nbsp; He was perfectly
acquainted with the country, being a sort of carrier or
carrier-merchant or shopkeeper, going frequently to Glasgow with
his horse and cart to fetch and carry goods and
merchandise.&nbsp; He knew the name of every hill, almost every
rock; and I made good use of his knowledge; but partly from
laziness, and still more because it was inconvenient, I took no
notes, and now I am little better for what he told me.&nbsp; He
spoke English tolerably; but seldom understood what was said to
him without a &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your wull?&rsquo;&nbsp; We
turned up to the right, and were at the foot of the
glen&mdash;the laird&rsquo;s house cannot be said to be <i>in</i>
the glen.&nbsp; The afternoon was delightful,&mdash;the sun
shone, the mountain-tops were clear, the lake glittered in the
great vale behind us, and the stream of Glen Coe flowed down to
it glittering among alder-trees.&nbsp; The meadows of the glen
were of the freshest green; one new-built stone house in the
first reach, some <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>huts, hillocks covered with wood,
alder-trees scattered all over.&nbsp; Looking backward, we were
reminded of Patterdale and the head of Ulswater, but forward the
greatness of the mountains overcame every other idea.</p>
<p>The impression was, as we advanced up to the head of this
first reach, as if the glen were nothing, its loneliness and
retirement&mdash;as if it made up no part of my feeling: the
mountains were all in all.&nbsp; That which fronted us&mdash;I
have forgotten its name&mdash;was exceedingly lofty, the surface
stony, nay, the whole mountain was one mass of stone, wrinkled
and puckered up together.&nbsp; At the second and last
reach&mdash;for it is not a winding vale&mdash;it makes a quick
turning almost at right angles to the first; and now we are in
the depths of the mountains; no trees in the glen, only green
pasturage for sheep, and here and there a plot of hay-ground, and
something that tells of former cultivation.&nbsp; I observed this
to the guide, who said that formerly the glen had had many
inhabitants, and that there, as elsewhere in the Highlands, there
had been a great deal of corn where now the lands were left
waste, and nothing fed upon them but cattle.&nbsp; I cannot
attempt to describe the mountains.&nbsp; I can only say that I
thought those on our right&mdash;for the other side was only a
continued high ridge or craggy barrier, broken along the top into
petty spiral forms&mdash;were the grandest I had ever seen.&nbsp;
It seldom happens that mountains in a very clear air look
exceedingly high, but these, though we could see the whole of
them to their very summits, appeared to me more majestic in their
own nakedness than our imaginations could have conceived them to
be, had they been half hidden by clouds, yet showing some of
their highest pinnacles.&nbsp; They were such forms as Milton
might be supposed to have had <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>in his mind
when he applied to Satan that sublime expression&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;His stature reached the sky.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first division of the glen, as I have said, was scattered
over with rocks, trees, and woody hillocks, and cottages were to
be seen here and there.&nbsp; The second division is bare and
stony, huge mountains on all sides, with a slender pasturage in
the bottom of the valley; and towards the head of it is a small
lake or tarn, and near the tarn a single inhabited dwelling, and
some unfenced hay-ground&mdash;a simple impressive scene!&nbsp;
Our road frequently crossed large streams of stones, left by the
mountain-torrents, losing all appearance of a road.&nbsp; After
we had passed the tarn the glen became less interesting, or
rather the mountains, from the manner in which they are looked
at; but again, a little higher up, they resume their
grandeur.&nbsp; The river is, for a short space, hidden between
steep rocks: we left the road, and, going to the top of one of
the rocks, saw it foaming over stones, or lodged in dark black
dens; birch-trees grew on the inaccessible banks, and a few old
Scotch firs towered above them.&nbsp; At the entrance of the glen
the mountains had been all without trees, but here the birches
climb very far up the side of one of them opposite to us, half
concealing a rivulet, which came tumbling down as white as snow
from the very top of the mountain.&nbsp; Leaving the rock, we
ascended a hill which terminated the glen.&nbsp; We often stopped
to look behind at the majestic company of mountains we had
left.&nbsp; Before us was no single paramount eminence, but a
mountain waste, mountain beyond mountain, and a barren hollow or
basin into which we were descending.</p>
<p>We parted from our companion at the door of a whisky <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>hovel, a building which, when it came out of the
workmen&rsquo;s hands with its unglassed windows, would, in that
forlorn region, have been little better than a howling place for
the winds, and was now half unroofed.&nbsp; On seeing a smoke, I
exclaimed, &lsquo;Is it possible any people can live
there?&rsquo; when at least half a dozen, men, women, and
children, came to the door.&nbsp; They were about to rebuild the
hut, and I suppose that they, or some other poor creatures, would
dwell there through the winter, dealing out whisky to the starved
travellers.&nbsp; The sun was now setting, the air very cold, the
sky clear; I could have fancied that it was winter-time, with
hard frost.&nbsp; Our guide pointed out King&rsquo;s House to us,
our resting-place for the night.&nbsp; We could just distinguish
the house at the bottom of the moorish hollow or basin&mdash;I
call it so, for it was nearly as broad as long&mdash;lying before
us, with three miles of naked road winding through it, every foot
of which we could see.&nbsp; The road was perfectly white, making
a dreary contrast with the ground, which was of a dull earthy
brown.&nbsp; Long as the line of road appeared before us, we
could scarcely believe it to be three miles&mdash;I suppose owing
to its being unbroken by any one object, and the moor naked as
the road itself, but we found it the longest three miles we had
yet travelled, for the surface was so stony we had to walk most
of the way.</p>
<p>The house looked respectable at a distance&mdash;a large
square building, cased in blue slates to defend it from
storms,&mdash;but when we came close to it the outside forewarned
us of the poverty and misery within.&nbsp; Scarce a blade of
grass could be seen growing upon the open ground; the heath-plant
itself found no nourishment there, appearing as if it had but
sprung up to be blighted.&nbsp; There was no enclosure for <!--
page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>a cow, no appropriated ground but a small plot like a
church yard, in which were a few starveling dwarfish potatoes,
which had, no doubt, been raised by means of the dung left by
travellers&rsquo; horses: they had not come to blossoming, and
whether they would either yield fruit or blossom I know
not.&nbsp; The first thing we saw on entering the door was two
sheep hung up, as if just killed from the barren moor, their
bones hardly sheathed in flesh.&nbsp; After we had waited a few
minutes, looking about for a guide to lead us into some corner of
the house, a woman, seemingly about forty years old, came to us
in a great bustle, screaming in Erse, with the most horrible
guinea-hen or peacock voice I ever heard, first to one person,
then another.&nbsp; She could hardly spare time to show us
up-stairs, for crowds of men were in the house&mdash;drovers,
carriers, horsemen, travellers, all of whom she had to provide
with supper, and she was, as she told us, the only woman
there.</p>
<p>Never did I see such a miserable, such a wretched
place,&mdash;long rooms with ranges of beds, no other furniture
except benches, or perhaps one or two crazy chairs, the floors
far dirtier than an ordinary house could be if it were never
washed,&mdash;as dirty as a house after a sale on a rainy day,
and the rooms being large, and the walls naked, they looked as if
more than half the goods had been sold out.&nbsp; We sate
shivering in one of the large rooms for three quarters of an hour
before the woman could find time to speak to us again; she then
promised a fire in another room, after two travellers, who were
going a stage further, had finished their whisky, and said we
should have supper as soon as possible.&nbsp; She had no eggs, no
milk, no potatoes, no loaf-bread, or we should have preferred
tea.&nbsp; With length of time the fire was kindled, and, after
another hour&rsquo;s waiting, supper <!-- page 177--><a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>came,&mdash;a shoulder of mutton so hard that it was
impossible to chew the little flesh that might be scraped off the
bones, and some sorry soup made of barley and water, for it had
no other taste.</p>
<p>After supper, the woman, having first asked if we slept on
blankets, brought in two pair of sheets, which she begged that I
would air by the fire, for they would be dirtied
below-stairs.&nbsp; I was very willing, but behold! the sheets
were so wet, that it would have been at least a two-hours&rsquo;
job before a far better fire than could be mustered at
King&rsquo;s House,&mdash;for, that nothing might be wanting to
make it a place of complete starvation, the peats were not dry,
and if they had not been helped out by decayed wood dug out of
the earth along with them, we should have had no fire at
all.&nbsp; The woman was civil, in her fierce, wild way.&nbsp;
She and the house, upon that desolate and extensive Wild, and
everything we saw, made us think of one of those places of
rendezvous which we read of in novels&mdash;Ferdinand Count
Fathom, or Gil Blas,&mdash;where there is one woman to receive
the booty, and prepare the supper at night.&nbsp; She told us
that she was only a servant, but that she had now lived there
five years, and that, when but a &lsquo;young lassie,&rsquo; she
had lived there also.&nbsp; We asked her if she had always served
the same master, &lsquo;Nay, nay, many masters, for they were
always changing.&rsquo;&nbsp; I verily believe that the woman was
attached to the place like a cat to the empty house when the
family who brought her up are gone to live elsewhere.&nbsp; The
sheets were so long in drying that it was very late before we
went to bed.&nbsp; We talked over our day&rsquo;s adventures by
the fireside, and often looked out of the window towards a huge
pyramidal mountain <a name="citation177"></a><a
href="#footnote177" class="citation">[177]</a> at the entrance
<!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>of Glen Coe.&nbsp; All between, the dreary waste was
clear, almost, as sky, the moon shining full upon it.&nbsp; A
rivulet ran amongst stones near the house, and sparkled with
light: I could have fancied that there was nothing else, in that
extensive circuit over which we looked, that had the power of
motion.</p>
<p>In comparing the impressions we had received at Glen Coe, we
found that though the expectations of both had been far surpassed
by the grandeur of the mountains, we had upon the whole both been
disappointed, and from the same cause: we had been prepared for
images of terror, had expected a deep, den-like valley with
overhanging rocks, such as William has described in these lines,
speaking of the Alps:&mdash;</p>

and road<br />
Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy Pass,<br />
And with them did we journey several hours<br />
At a slow step.&nbsp; The immeasurable height<br />
Of woods decaying, never to be decayed!<br />
The stationary blasts of waterfalls;<br />
And everywhere along the hollow rent<br />
Winds thwarting winds, bewilder&rsquo;d and forlorn;<br />
The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,<br />
The rocks that mutter&rsquo;d close upon our ears,<br />
Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side<br />
As if a voice were in them; the sick sight<br />
And giddy prospect of the raving stream;<br />
The unfetter&rsquo;d clouds, and region of the heavens,<br />
Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light,<br />
Were all like workings of one mind, the features<br />
Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree,<br />
Characters of the great Apocalypse,<br />

179</span>The Types and Symbols of Eternity,<br />
Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.</p>
<p>The place had nothing of this character, the glen being open
to the eye of day, the mountains retiring in independent
majesty.&nbsp; Even in the upper part of it, where the stream
rushed through the rocky chasm, it was but a deep trench in the
vale, not the vale itself, and could only be seen when we were
close to it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>FOURTH WEEK.</h2>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>September</i> 4<i>th</i>.&mdash;We had
desired to be called at six o&rsquo;clock, and rose at the first
summons.&nbsp; Our beds had proved better than we expected, and
we had not slept ill; but poor Coleridge had passed a wretched
night here four days before.&nbsp; This we did not know; but
since, when he told us of it, the notion of what he must have
suffered, with the noise of drunken people about his ears all
night, himself sick and tired, has made our discomfort cling to
my memory, and given these recollections a twofold
interest.&nbsp; I asked if it was possible to have a couple of
eggs boiled before our departure: the woman hesitated; she
thought I might, and sent a boy into the out-houses to look
about, who brought in one egg after long searching.&nbsp; Early
as we had risen it was not very early when we set off; for
everything at King&rsquo;s House was in unison&mdash;equally
uncomfortable.&nbsp; As the woman had told us the night before,
&lsquo;They had no hay, and that was a loss.&rsquo;&nbsp; There
were neither stalls nor bedding in the stable, so that William
was obliged to watch the horse while it was feeding, for there
were several others in the stable, all standing like wild beasts,
ready to devour each other&rsquo;s portion of corn: this, with
the slowness of the servant and other hindrances, took up much
time, and we were completely starved, for the morning was very
cold, as I believe all the mornings in that desolate place
are.</p>
<p><!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>When we had gone about a quarter of a mile I
recollected that I had left the little cup given me by the kind
landlady at Taynuilt, which I had intended that John should
hereafter drink out of, in memory of our wanderings.&nbsp; I
would have turned back for it, but William pushed me on,
unwilling that we should lose so much time, though indeed he was
as sorry to part with it as myself.</p>
<p>Our road was over a hill called the Black Mount.&nbsp; For the
first mile, or perhaps more, after we left King&rsquo;s House, we
ascended on foot; then came upon a new road, one of the finest
that was ever trod; and, as we went downwards almost all the way
afterwards, we travelled very quickly.&nbsp; The motion was
pleasant, the different reaches and windings of the road were
amusing; the sun shone, the mountain-tops were clear and
cheerful, and we in good spirits, in a bustle of enjoyment,
though there never was a more desolate region: mountains behind,
before, and on every side; I do not remember to have seen either
patch of grass, flower, or flowering heather within three or four
miles of King&rsquo;s House.&nbsp; The low ground was not rocky,
but black, and full of white frost-bleached stones, the prospect
only varied by pools, seen everywhere both near and at a
distance, as far as the ground stretched out below us: these were
interesting spots, round which the mind assembled living objects,
and they shone as bright as mirrors in the forlorn waste.&nbsp;
We passed neither tree nor shrub for miles&mdash;I include the
whole space from Glen Coe&mdash;yet we saw perpetually traces of
a long decayed forest, pieces of black mouldering wood.</p>
<p>Through such a country as this we had travelled perhaps seven
and a half miles this morning, when, after descending a hill, we
turned to the right, and saw an <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>unexpected
sight in the moorland hollow into which we were entering, a small
lake bounded on the opposite side by a grove of Scotch firs, two
or three cottages at the head of it, and a lot of cultivated
ground with scattered hay-cocks.&nbsp; The road along which we
were going, after having made a curve considerably above the
tarn, was seen winding through the trees on the other side, a
beautiful object, and, luckily for us, a drove of cattle happened
to be passing there at the very time, a stream coursing the road,
with off-stragglers to the borders of the lake, and under the
trees on the sloping ground.</p>
<p>In conning over our many wanderings I shall never forget the
gentle pleasure with which we greeted the lake of Inveroran and
its few grey cottages: we suffered our horse to slacken his pace,
having now no need of the comfort of quick motion, though we were
glad to think that one of those cottages might be the
public-house where we were to breakfast.&nbsp; A
forest&mdash;now, as it appeared, dwindled into the small grove
bordering the lake&mdash;had, not many years ago, spread to that
side of the vale where we were: large stumps of trees which had
been cut down were yet remaining undecayed, and there were some
single trees left alive, as if by their battered black boughs to
tell us of the storms that visit the valley which looked now so
sober and peaceful.&nbsp; When we arrived at the huts, one of
them proved to be the inn, a thatched house without a
sign-board.&nbsp; We were kindly received, had a fire lighted in
the parlour, and were in such good humour that we seemed to have
a thousand comforts about us; but we had need of a little
patience in addition to this good humour before breakfast was
brought, and at last it proved a disappointment: the butter not
eatable, the barley-cakes <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>fusty, the
oat-bread so hard I could not chew it, and there were only four
eggs in the house, which they had boiled as hard as stones.</p>
<p>Before we had finished breakfast two foot-travellers came in,
and seated themselves at our table; one of them was returning,
after a long absence, to Fort-William, his native home; he had
come from Egypt, and, many years ago, had been on a recruiting
party at Penrith, and knew many people there.&nbsp; He seemed to
think his own country but a dismal land.</p>
<p>There being no bell in the parlour, I had occasion to go
several times and ask for what we wanted in the kitchen, and I
would willingly have given twenty pounds to have been able to
take a lively picture of it.&nbsp; About seven or eight
travellers, probably drovers, with as many dogs, were sitting in
a complete circle round a large peat-fire in the middle of the
floor, each with a mess of porridge, in a wooden vessel, upon his
knee; a pot, suspended from one of the black beams, was boiling
on the fire; two or three women pursuing their household business
on the outside of the circle, children playing on the
floor.&nbsp; There was nothing uncomfortable in this confusion:
happy, busy, or vacant faces, all looked pleasant; and even the
smoky air, being a sort of natural indoor atmosphere of Scotland,
served only to give a softening, I may say harmony, to the
whole.</p>
<p>We departed immediately after breakfast; our road leading us,
as I have said, near the lake-side and through the grove of firs,
which extended backward much further than we had imagined.&nbsp;
After we had left it we came again among bare moorish wastes, as
before, under the mountains, so that Inveroran still lives in our
recollection as a favoured place, a flower in the desert.</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>Descended upon the whole, I believe very considerably,
in our way to Tyndrum; but it was a road of long ups and downs,
over hills and through hollows of uncultivated ground; a chance
farm perhaps once in three miles, a glittering rivulet bordered
with greener grass than grew on the broad waste, or a broken
fringe of alders or birches, partly concealing and partly
pointing out its course.</p>
<p>Arrived at Tyndrum at about two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is a
cold spot.&nbsp; Though, as I should suppose, situated lower than
Inveroran, and though we saw it in the hottest time of the
afternoon sun, it had a far colder aspect from the want of
trees.&nbsp; We were here informed that Coleridge, who, we
supposed, was gone to Edinburgh, had dined at this very house a
few days before, in his road to Fort-William.&nbsp; By the help
of the cook, who was called in, the landlady made out the very
day: it was the day after we parted from him; as she expressed
it, the day after the &lsquo;great speet,&rsquo; namely, the
great rain.&nbsp; We had a moorfowl and mutton-chops for dinner,
well cooked, and a reasonable charge.&nbsp; The house was clean
for a Scotch inn, and the people about the doors were well
dressed.&nbsp; In one of the parlours we saw a company of nine or
ten, with the landlady, seated round a plentiful table,&mdash;a
sight which made us think of the fatted calf in the alehouse
pictures of the Prodigal Son.&nbsp; There seemed to be a whole
harvest of meats and drinks, and there was something of festivity
and picture-like gaiety even in the fresh-coloured dresses of the
people and their Sunday faces.&nbsp; The white table-cloth,
glasses, English dishes, etc., were all in contrast with what we
had seen at Inveroran: the places were but about nine miles
asunder, both among hills; the rank of the people little
different, and each house appeared to be a house of plenty.</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>We were I think better pleased with our treatment at
this inn than any of the lonely houses on the road, except
Taynuilt; but Coleridge had not fared so well, and was
dissatisfied, as he has since told us, and the two travellers who
breakfasted with us at Inveroran had given a bad account of the
house.</p>
<p>Left Tyndrum at about five o&rsquo;clock; a gladsome
afternoon; the road excellent, and we bowled downwards through a
pleasant vale, though not populous, or well cultivated, or woody,
but enlivened by a river that glittered as it flowed.&nbsp; On
the side of a sunny hill a knot of men and women were gathered
together at a preaching.&nbsp; We passed by many droves of cattle
and Shetland ponies, which accident stamped a character upon
places, else unrememberable&mdash;not an individual character,
but the soul, the spirit, and solitary simplicity of many a
Highland region.</p>
<p>We had about eleven miles to travel before we came to our
lodging, and had gone five or six, almost always descending, and
still in the same vale, when we saw a small lake before us after
the vale had made a bending to the left; it was about sunset when
we came up to the lake; the afternoon breezes had died away, and
the water was in perfect stillness.&nbsp; One grove-like island,
with a ruin that stood upon it overshadowed by the trees, was
reflected on the water.&nbsp; This building, which, on that
beautiful evening, seemed to be wrapped up in religious quiet, we
were informed had been raised for defence by some Highland
chieftain.&nbsp; All traces of strength, or war, or danger are
passed away, and in the mood in which we were we could only look
upon it as a place of retirement and peace.&nbsp; The lake is
called Loch Dochart.&nbsp; We passed by two others of inferior
beauty, and continued to travel along the side of <!-- page
186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>the same river, the Dochart, through an irregular,
undetermined vale,&mdash;poor soil and much waste land.</p>
<p>At that time of the evening when, by looking steadily, we
could discover a few pale stars in the sky, we saw upon an
eminence, the bound of our horizon, though very near to us, and
facing the bright yellow clouds of the west, a group of figures
that made us feel how much we wanted in not being painters.&nbsp;
Two herdsmen, with a dog beside them, were sitting on the hill,
overlooking a herd of cattle scattered over a large meadow by the
river-side.&nbsp; Their forms, looked at through a fading light,
and backed by the bright west, were exceedingly distinct, a
beautiful picture in the quiet of a Sabbath evening, exciting
thoughts and images of almost patriarchal simplicity and
grace.&nbsp; We were much pleased with the situation of our inn,
where we arrived between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The
river was at the distance of a broad field from the door; we
could see it from the upper windows and hear its murmuring; the
moon shone, enlivening the large corn fields with cheerful
light.&nbsp; We had a bad supper, and the next morning they made
us an unreasonable charge; and the servant was uncivil, because,
forsooth! we had no wine.</p>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The travellers in the morning had spoken
highly of this inn. <a name="citation186"></a><a

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Monday</i>, <i>September</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;After
drinking a bason of milk we set off again at a little after six
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;a fine morning&mdash;eight miles to
Killin&mdash;the river Dochart always on our left.&nbsp; The face
of the country not very interesting, though not unpleasing,
reminding us of some of the vales of the north of England, though
meagre, nipped-up, or <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>shrivelled compared with them.&nbsp;
There were rocks, and rocky knolls, as about Grasmere and
Wytheburn, and copses, but of a starveling growth; the cultivated
ground poor.&nbsp; Within a mile or two of Killin the land was
better cultivated, and, looking down the vale, we had a view of
Loch Tay, into which the Dochart falls.&nbsp; Close to the town,
the river took up a roaring voice, beating its way over a rocky
descent among large black stones: islands in the middle turning
the stream this way and that; the whole course of the river very
wide.&nbsp; We crossed it by means of three bridges, which make
one continued bridge of a great length.&nbsp; On an island below
the bridge is a gateway with tall pillars, leading to an old
burying-ground belonging to some noble family. <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a>&nbsp; It has a singular appearance,
and the place is altogether uncommon and romantic&mdash;a remnant
of ancient grandeur: extreme natural wildness&mdash;the sound of
roaring water, and withal, the ordinary half-village, half-town
bustle of an every-day place.</p>
<p>The inn at Killin is one of the largest on the Scotch road: it
stands pleasantly, near the chapel, at some distance from the
river Dochart, and out of reach of its tumultuous noise; and
another broad, stately, and silent stream, which you cannot look
at without remembering its boisterous neighbour, flows close
under the windows of the inn, and beside the churchyard, in which
are many graves.&nbsp; That river falls into the lake at the
distance of nearly a mile from the mouth of the Dochart.&nbsp; It
is bordered with tall trees and corn fields, bearing plentiful
crops, the richest we had seen in Scotland.</p>
<p>After breakfast we walked onwards, expecting that the stream
would lead us into some considerable vale; but it <!-- page
188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>soon became little better than a common rivulet, and
the glen appeared to be short; indeed, we wondered how the river
had grown so great all at once.&nbsp; Our horse had not been able
to eat his corn, and we waited a long time in the hope that he
would be better.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock, however, we
determined to set off, and give him all the ease possible by
walking up the hills, and not pushing beyond a slow walk.&nbsp;
We had fourteen miles to travel to Kenmore, by the side of Loch
Tay.&nbsp; Crossed the same bridge again, and went down the south
side of the lake.&nbsp; We had a delightful view of the village
of Killin, among rich green fields, corn and wood, and up towards
the two horns of the vale of Tay, the valley of the Dochart, and
the other valley with its full-grown river, the prospect
terminated by mountains.&nbsp; We travelled through lanes, woods,
or open fields, never close to the lake, but always near it, for
many miles, the road being carried along the side of a hill,
which rose in an almost regularly receding steep from the
lake.&nbsp; The opposite shore did not much differ from that down
which we went, but it seemed more thinly inhabited, and not so
well cultivated.&nbsp; The sun shone, the cottages were pleasant,
and the goings-on of the harvest&mdash;for all the inhabitants
were at work in the corn fields&mdash;made the way
cheerful.&nbsp; But there is an uniformity in the lake which,
comparing it with other lakes, made it appear tiresome.&nbsp; It
has no windings: I should even imagine, although it is so many
miles long, that, from some points not very high on the hills, it
may be seen from one end to the other.&nbsp; There are few bays,
no lurking-places where the water hides itself in the land, no
outjutting points or promontories, no islands; and there are no
commanding mountains or precipices.&nbsp; I think that this lake
would be the most pleasing in spring-time, or in <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>summer before the corn begins to change colour, the
long tracts of hills on each side of the vale having at this
season a kind of patchy appearance, for the corn fields in
general were very small, mere plots, and of every possible shade
of bright yellow.&nbsp; When we came in view of the foot of the
lake we perceived that it ended, as it had begun, in pride and
loveliness.&nbsp; The village of Kenmore, with its neat church
and cleanly houses, stands on a gentle eminence at the end of the
water.&nbsp; The view, though not near so beautiful as that of
Killin, is exceedingly pleasing.&nbsp; Left our car, and turned
out of the road at about the distance of a mile from the town,
and after having climbed perhaps a quarter of a mile, we were
conducted into a locked-up plantation, and guessed by the sound
that we were near the cascade, but could not see it.&nbsp; Our
guide opened a door, and we entered a dungeon-like passage, and,
after walking some yards in total darkness, found ourselves in a
quaint apartment stuck over with moss, hung about with stuffed
foxes and other wild animals, and ornamented with a library of
wooden books covered with old leather backs, the mock furniture
of a hermit&rsquo;s cell.&nbsp; At the end of the room, through a
large bow-window, we saw the waterfall, and at the same time,
looking down to the left, the village of Kenmore and a part of
the lake&mdash;a very beautiful prospect.</p>

191</span><i>April</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1805.&mdash;I am setting
about a task which, however free and happy the state of my mind,
I could not have performed well at this distance of time; but
now, I do not know that I shall be able to go on with it at
all.&nbsp; I will strive, however, to do the best I can, setting
before myself a different object from that hitherto aimed at,
which was, to omit no incident, however trifling, and to describe
the country so minutely that you should, where the objects were
the most interesting, feel as if you had been with us.&nbsp; I
shall now only attempt to give you an idea of those scenes which
pleased us most, dropping the incidents of the ordinary days, of
which many have slipped from my memory, and others which remain
it would be difficult, and often painful to me, to endeavour to
draw out and disentangle from other thoughts.&nbsp; I the less
regret my inability to do more, because, in describing a great
part of what we saw from the time we left Kenmore, my work would
be little more than a repetition of what I have said before, or,
where it was not so, a longer time was necessary to enable us to
bear away what was most interesting than we could afford to
give.</p>

193</span><i>Monday</i>, <i>September</i> 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;We
arrived at Kenmore after sunset.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>September</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Walked
before breakfast in Lord Breadalbane&rsquo;s grounds, which
border upon the river Tay.&nbsp; The higher elevations command
fine views of the lake; and the walks are led along the
river&rsquo;s banks, and shaded with tall trees: but it seemed to
us that a bad taste had been at work, the banks being regularly
shaven and cut as if by rule and line.&nbsp; One or two of such
walks I should well have liked to see; but they are all equally
trim, and I could not but regret that the fine trees had not been
left to grow out of a turf that cattle were permitted to feed
upon.&nbsp; There was one avenue which would well have graced the
ruins of an abbey or some stately castle.&nbsp; It was of a very
great length, perfectly straight, the trees meeting at the top in
a cathedral arch, lessening in perspective,&mdash;the boughs the
roof, the stems the pillars.&nbsp; I never saw so beautiful an
avenue.&nbsp; We were told that some improver of pleasure-grounds
had advised Lord B. to cut down the trees, and lay the whole open
to the lawn, for the avenue is very near his house.&nbsp; His own
better taste, or that of some other person, I suppose, had saved
them from the axe.&nbsp; Many workmen were employed in building a
large mansion something like that of Inverary, close to the old
house, <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>which was yet standing; the
situation, as we thought, very bad, considering that Lord
Breadalbane had the command of all the ground at the foot of the
lake, including hills both high and low.&nbsp; It is in a hollow,
without prospect either of the lake or river, or anything
else&mdash;seeing nothing, and adorning nothing.&nbsp; After
breakfast, left Kenmore, and travelled through the vale of Tay, I
believe fifteen or sixteen miles; but in the course of this we
turned out of our way to the Falls of Moness, a stream tributary
to the Tay, which passes through a narrow glen with very steep
banks.&nbsp; A path like a woodman&rsquo;s track has been carried
through the glen, which, though the private property of a
gentleman, has not been taken out of the hands of Nature, but
merely rendered accessible by this path, which ends at the
waterfalls.&nbsp; They tumble from a great height, and are indeed
very beautiful falls, and we could have sate with pleasure the
whole morning beside the cool basin in which the waters rest,
surrounded by high rocks and overhanging trees.&nbsp; In one of
the most retired parts of the dell, we met a young man coming
slowly along the path, intent upon a book which he was reading:
he did not seem to be of the rank of a gentleman, though above
that of a peasant.</p>
<p>Passed through the village of Aberfeldy, at the foot of the
glen of Moness.&nbsp; The birks of Aberfeldy are spoken of in
some of the Scotch songs, which no doubt grew in the stream of
Moness; but near the village we did not see any trees that were
remarkable, except a row of laburnums, growing as a common field
hedge; their leaves were of a golden colour, and as lively as the
yellow blossoms could have been in the spring.&nbsp; Afterwards
we saw many laburnums in the woods, which we were told had been
&lsquo;planted;&rsquo; though I remember that Withering speaks
<!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>of the laburnum as one of the British plants, and
growing in Scotland.&nbsp; The twigs and branches being stiff,
were not so graceful as those of our garden laburnums, but I do
not think I ever before saw any that were of so brilliant colours
in their autumnal decay.&nbsp; In our way to and from Moness we
crossed the Tay by a bridge of ambitious and ugly
architecture.&nbsp; Many of the bridges in Scotland are so,
having eye-holes between the arches, not in the battlements but
at the outspreading of the pillar of the arch, which destroys its
simplicity, and takes from the appearance of strength and
security, without adding anything of lightness.&nbsp; We
returned, by the same road, to the village of Weem, where we had
left our car.&nbsp; The vale of Tay was very wide, having been so
from within a short distance of Kenmore: the reaches of the river
are long; and the ground is more regularly cultivated than in any
vale we had yet seen&mdash;chiefly corn, and very large
tracts.&nbsp; Afterwards the vale becomes narrow and less
cultivated, the reaches shorter&mdash;on the whole resembling the
vale of Nith, but we thought it inferior in beauty.</p>
<p>One among the cottages in this narrow and wilder part of the
vale fixed our attention almost as much as a Chinese or a Turk
would do passing through the vale of Grasmere.&nbsp; It was a
cottage, I believe, little differing in size and shape from all
the rest; but it was like a visitor, a stranger come into the
Highlands, or a model set up of what may be seen in other
countries.&nbsp; The walls were neatly plastered or roughcast,
the windows of clean bright glass, and the door was
painted&mdash;before it a flower-garden, fenced with a
curiously-clipped hedge, and against the wall was placed the sign
of a spinning-wheel.&nbsp; We could not pass this humble
dwelling, so distinguished by an appearance of comfort <!-- page
196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>and neatness, without some conjectures respecting the
character and manner of life of the person inhabiting it.&nbsp;
Leisure he must have had; and we pleased ourselves with thinking
that some self-taught mind might there have been nourished by
knowledge gathered from books, and the simple duties and
pleasures of rural life.</p>
<p>At Logierait, the village where we dined, the vale widens
again, and the Tummel joins the Tay and loses its name; but the
Tay falls into the channel of the Tummel, continuing its course
in the same direction, almost at right angles to the former
course of the Tay.&nbsp; We were sorry to find that we had to
cross the Tummel by a ferry, and resolved not to venture in the
same boat with the horse.&nbsp; Dined at a little public-house,
kept by a young widow, very talkative and laboriously
civil.&nbsp; She took me out to the back-door, and said she would
show me a place which had once been very grand, and, opening a
door in a high wall, I entered a ruinous court-yard, in which was
a large old mansion, the walls entire and very strong, but the
roof broken in.&nbsp; The woman said it had been a palace <a
name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a> of one of the kings of Scotland.&nbsp;
It was a striking and even an affecting object, coming upon it,
as I did, unawares,&mdash;a royal residence shut up and hidden,
while yet in its strength, by mean cottages; there was no
appearance of violence, but decay from desertion, and I should
think that it may remain many years without undergoing further
visible change.&nbsp; The woman and her daughter accompanied us
to the ferry and crossed the water with us; the woman said, but
with not much appearance of honest heart-feeling, that she could
not be easy to let us go without being there to know how we sped,
so I invited the little girl to accompany her, that she might
have a ride in the car.&nbsp; The men <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>were
cautious, and the horse got over with less alarm than we could
have expected.&nbsp; Our way was now up the vale, along the banks
of the Tummel, an impetuous river; the mountains higher than near
the Tay, and the vale more wild, and the different reaches more
interesting.</p>
<p>When we approached near to Fascally, near the junction of the
Garry with the Tummel, the twilight was far advanced, and our
horse not being perfectly recovered, we were fearful of taking
him on to Blair-Athole&mdash;five miles further; besides, the
Pass of Killicrankie was within half a mile, and we were
unwilling to go through a place so celebrated in the dark;
therefore, being joined by a traveller, we inquired if there was
any public-house near; he said there was; and that though the
accommodations were not good, we might do well enough for one
night, the host and his wife being very honest people.&nbsp; It
proved to be rather better than a common cottage of the country;
we seated ourselves by the fire, William called for a glass of
whisky, and asked if they could give us beds.&nbsp; The woman
positively refused to lodge us, though we had every reason to
believe that she had at least one bed for me; we entreated again
and again in behalf of the poor horse, but all in vain; she
urged, though in an uncivil way, that she had been sitting up the
whole of one or two nights before on account of a fair, and that
now she wanted to go to bed and sleep; so we were obliged to
remount our car in the dark, and with a tired horse we moved on,
and went through the Pass of Killicrankie, hearing only the
roaring of the river, and seeing a black chasm with jagged-topped
black hills towering above.&nbsp; Afterwards the moon rose, and
we should not have had an unpleasant ride if our horse had been
in better plight, and we had not been <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>annoyed, as
we were almost at every twenty yards, by people coming from a
fair held that day near Blair&mdash;no pleasant prognostic of
what might be our accommodation at the inn, where we arrived
between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock, and found the house in an
uproar; but we were civilly treated, and were glad, after eating
a morsel of cold beef, to retire to rest, and I fell asleep in
spite of the noisy drunkards below stairs, who had outstayed the
fair.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>September</i> 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rose
early, and went before breakfast to the Duke of Athol&rsquo;s
gardens and pleasure-grounds, where we completely tired ourselves
with a three-hours&rsquo; walk.&nbsp; Having been directed to see
all the waterfalls, we submitted ourselves to the gardener, who
dragged us from place to place, calling our attention to, it
might be, half-a-dozen&mdash;I cannot say how many&mdash;dripping
streams, very pretty in themselves, if we had had the pleasure of
discovering them; but they were generally robbed of their grace
by the obtrusive ornaments which were first seen.&nbsp; The whole
neighbourhood, a great country, seems to belong to the Duke of
Athol.&nbsp; In his domain are hills and mountains, glens and
spacious plains, rivers and innumerable torrents; but near Blair
are no old woods, and the plantations, except those at a little
distance from the house, appear inconsiderable, being lost to the
eye in so extensive a circuit.</p>
<p>The castle stands on low ground, and far from the Garry,
commanding a prospect all round of distant mountains, a bare and
cold scene, and, from the irregularity and width of it, not so
grand as one should expect, knowing the great height of some of
the mountains.&nbsp; Within the <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>Duke&rsquo;s park are three glens, the glen of the
river Tilt and two others, which, if they had been planted more
judiciously, would have been very sweet retirements; but they are
choked up, the whole hollow of the glens&mdash;I do not speak of
the Tilt, for that is rich in natural wood&mdash;being closely
planted with trees, and those chiefly firs; but many of the old
fir-trees are, as single trees, very fine.&nbsp; On each side of
the glen is an ell-wide gravel walk, which the gardener told us
was swept once a week.&nbsp; It is conducted at the top of the
banks, on each side, at nearly equal height, and equal distance
from the stream; they lead you up one of these paths, and down
the other&mdash;very wearisome, as you will believe&mdash;mile
after mile!&nbsp; We went into the garden, where there was plenty
of fruit&mdash;gooseberries, hanging as thick as possible upon
the trees, ready to drop off; I thought the gardener might have
invited us to refresh ourselves with some of his fruit after our
long fatigue.&nbsp; One part of the garden was decorated with
statues, &lsquo;images,&rsquo; as poor Mr. Gill used to call
those at Racedown, dressed in gay-painted clothes; and in a
retired corner of the grounds, under some tall trees, appeared
the figure of a favourite old gamekeeper of one of the former
Dukes, in the attitude of pointing his gun at the
game&mdash;&lsquo;reported to be a striking likeness,&rsquo; said
the gardener.&nbsp; Looking at some of the tall larches, with
long hairy twigs, very beautiful trees, he told us that they were
among the first which had ever been planted in Scotland, that a
Duke of Athol had brought a single larch from London in a pot, in
his coach, from which had sprung the whole family that had
overspread Scotland.&nbsp; This, probably, might not be accurate,
for others might afterwards have come, or seed from other
trees.&nbsp; He told us many anecdotes of the present <!-- page
200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>Duke, which I wish I could perfectly remember.&nbsp; He
is an indefatigable sportsman, hunts the wild deer on foot,
attended by twelve Highlanders in the Highland dress, which he
himself formerly used to wear; he will go out at four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and not return till night.&nbsp;
His fine family, &lsquo;Athol&rsquo;s honest men, and
Athol&rsquo;s bonny lasses,&rsquo; to whom Burns, in his bumpers,
drank health and long life, are dwindled away: of nine, I believe
only four are left: the mother of them is dead in a consumption,
and the Duke married again.&nbsp; We rested upon the heather seat
which Burns was so loth to quit that moonlight evening when he
first went to Blair Castle, and had a pleasure in thinking that
he had been under the same shelter, and viewed the little
waterfall opposite with some of the happy and pure feelings of
his better mind.&nbsp; The castle has been modernized, which has
spoiled its appearance.&nbsp; It is a large irregular pile, not
handsome, but I think may have been picturesque, and even noble,
before it was docked of its battlements and whitewashed.</p>
<p>The most interesting object we saw at Blair was the chapel,
shaded by trees, in which the body of the impetuous Dundee lies
buried.&nbsp; This quiet spot is seen from the windows of the
inn, whence you look, at the same time, upon a high wall and a
part of the town&mdash;a contrast which, I know not why, made the
chapel and its grove appear more peaceful, as if kept so for some
sacred purpose.&nbsp; We had a very nice breakfast, which we
sauntered over after our weary walk.</p>
<p>Being come to the most northerly point of our destined course,
we took out the map, loth to turn our backs upon the Highlands,
and, looking about for something which we might yet see, we fixed
our eyes upon two or three spots <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>not far
distant, and sent for the landlord to consult with him.&nbsp; One
of them was Loch Rannoch, a fresh-water lake, which he told us
was bordered by a natural pine forest, that its banks were
populous, and that the place being very remote, we might there
see much of the simplicity of the Highlander&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
The landlord said that we must take a guide for the first nine or
ten miles; but afterwards the road was plain before us, and very
good, so at about ten o&rsquo;clock we departed, having engaged a
man to go with us.&nbsp; The Falls of Bruar, which we wished to
visit for the sake of Burns, are about three miles from Blair,
and our road was in the same direction for two miles.</p>
<p>After having gone for some time under a bare hill, we were
told to leave the car at some cottages, and pass through a little
gate near a brook which crossed the road.&nbsp; We walked upwards
at least three quarters of a mile in the hot sun, with the stream
on our right, both sides of which to a considerable height were
planted with firs and larches intermingled&mdash;children of poor
Burns&rsquo;s song; for his sake we wished that they had been the
natural trees of Scotland, birches, ashes, mountain-ashes, etc.;
however, sixty or seventy years hence they will be no unworthy
monument to his memory.&nbsp; At present, nothing can be uglier
than the whole chasm of the hill-side with its formal
walks.&nbsp; I do not mean to condemn them, for, for aught I
know, they are as well managed as they could be; but it is not
easy to see the use of a pleasure-path leading to nothing, up a
steep and naked hill in the midst of an unlovely tract of
country, though by the side of a tumbling stream of clear
water.&nbsp; It does not surely deserve the name of a
pleasure-path.&nbsp; It is three miles from the Duke of
Athol&rsquo;s house, and I do not believe that one person living
within five miles <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>of the place would wish to go twice
to it.&nbsp; The falls are high, the rocks and stones fretted and
gnawed by the water.&nbsp; I do not wonder at the pleasure which
Burns received from this stream; I believe we should have been
much pleased if we had come upon it as he did.&nbsp; At the
bottom of the hill we took up our car, and, turning back, joined
the man who was to be our guide.</p>
<p>Crossed the Garry, and went along a moor without any road but
straggling cart-tracks.&nbsp; Soon began to ascend a high hill,
and the ground grew so rough&mdash;road there was none&mdash;that
we were obliged to walk most of the way.&nbsp; Ascended to a
considerable height, and commanded an extensive prospect bounded
by lofty mountains, and having crossed the top of the fell we
parted with our guide, being in sight of the vale into which we
were to descend, and to pursue upwards till we should come to
Loch Rannoch, a lake, as described to us, bedded in a forest of
Scotch pines.</p>
<p>When left to ourselves we sate down on the hillside, and
looked with delight into the deep vale below, which was
exceedingly green, not regularly fenced or cultivated, but the
level area scattered over with bushes and trees, and through that
level ground glided a glassy river, not in serpentine windings,
but in direct turnings backwards and forwards, and then flowed
into the head of the Lake of Tummel; but I will copy a rough
sketch which I made while we sate upon the hill, which, imperfect
as it is, will give a better idea of the course of the
river&mdash;which I must add is more curious than
beautiful&mdash;than my description.&nbsp; The ground must be
often overflowed in winter, for the water seemed to touch the
very edge of its banks.&nbsp; At this time the scene was soft and
cheerful, such as invited us downwards, and made us proud of our
adventure.</p>
<p><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>Coming near to a cluster of huts, we turned thither, a
few steps out of our way, to inquire about the road; these huts
were on the hill, placed side by side, in a figure between a
square and a circle, as if for the sake of mutual shelter, like
haystacks in a farmyard&mdash;no trees near them.&nbsp; We called
at one of the doors, and three hale, stout men came out, who
could speak very little English, and stared at us with an almost
savage look of wonder.&nbsp; One of them took much pains to set
us forward, and went a considerable way down the hill till we
came in sight of the cart road, which we were to follow; but we
had not gone far before we were disheartened.&nbsp; It was with
the greatest difficulty William could lead the horse and car over
the rough stones, and to sit in it was impossible; the road grew
worse and worse, therefore we resolved to turn back, having no
reason to expect anything better, for we had been told that after
we should leave the untracked ground all would be fair before
us.&nbsp; We knew ourselves where we stood to be about eight
miles distant from the point where the river Tummel, after having
left the lake, joins the Garry at Fascally near the Pass of
Killicrankie, therefore we resolved to make our way thither, and
endeavour to procure a lodging at the same public-house where it
had been refused to us the night before.&nbsp; The road was
likely to be very bad; but, knowing the distance, we thought it
more prudent than to venture farther with nothing before us but
uncertainty.&nbsp; We were forced to unyoke the horse, and turn
the car ourselves, owing to the steep banks on either side of the
road, and after much trouble we got him in again, and set our
faces down the vale towards Loch Tummel, William leading the car
and I walking by his side.</p>
<p>For the first two or three miles we looked down upon <!-- page
204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>the lake, our road being along the side of the hill
directly above it.&nbsp; On the opposite side another range of
hills rose up in the same manner,&mdash;farm-houses thinly
scattered among the copses near the water, and cultivated ground
in patches.&nbsp; The lake does not wind, nor are the shores much
varied by bays,&mdash;the mountains not commanding; but the whole
a pleasing scene.&nbsp; Our road took us out of sight of the
water, and we were obliged to procure a guide across a high moor,
where it was impossible that the horse should drag us at all, the
ground being exceedingly rough and untracked: of course fatiguing
for foot-travellers, and on foot we must travel.&nbsp; After some
time, the river Tummel again served us for a guide, when it had
left the lake.&nbsp; It was no longer a gentle stream, a mirror
to the sky, but we could hear it roaring at a considerable
distance between steep banks of rock and wood.&nbsp; We had to
cross the Garry by a bridge, a little above the junction of the
two rivers; and were now not far from the public-house, to our
great joy, for we were very weary with our laborious walk.&nbsp;
I do not think that I had walked less than sixteen miles, and
William much more, to which add the fatigue of leading the horse,
and the rough roads, and you will not wonder that we longed for
rest.&nbsp; We stopped at the door of the house, and William
entered as before, and again the woman refused to lodge us, in a
most inhuman manner, giving no other reason than that she would
not do it.&nbsp; We pleaded for the poor horse, entreated,
soothed, and flattered, but all in vain, though the night was
cloudy and dark.&nbsp; We begged to sit by the fire till morning,
and to this she would not consent; indeed, if it had not been for
the sake of the horse, I would rather have lain in a barn than on
the best of feather-beds in the house of such a cruel woman.</p>

205</span>We were now, after our long day&rsquo;s journey, five
miles from the inn at Blair, whither we, at first, thought of
returning; but finally resolved to go to a public-house which we
had seen in a village we passed through, about a mile above the
ferry over the Tummel, having come from that point to Blair, for
the sake of the Pass of Killicrankie and Blair itself, and had
now the same road to measure back again.&nbsp; We were obliged to
leave the Pass of Killicrankie unseen; but this disturbed us
little at a time when we had seven miles to travel in the dark,
with a poor beast almost sinking with fatigue, for he had not
rested once all day.&nbsp; We went on spiritless, and at a dreary
pace.&nbsp; Passed by one house which we were half inclined to go
up to and ask for a night&rsquo;s lodging; and soon after, being
greeted by a gentle voice from a poor woman, whom, till she
spoke, though we were close to her, we had not seen, we stopped,
and asked if she could tell us where we might stay all night, and
put up our horse.&nbsp; She mentioned the public-house left
behind, and we told our tale, and asked her if she had no house
to which she could take us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, to be sure she had
a house, but it was only a small cottage;&rsquo; and she had no
place for the horse, and how we could lodge in her house she
could not tell; but we should be welcome to whatever she had, so
we turned the car, and she walked by the side of it, talking to
us in a tone of human kindness which made us friends at once.</p>
<p>I remember thinking to myself, as I have often done in a
stage-coach, though never with half the reason to prejudge
favourably, What sort of countenance and figure shall we see in
this woman when we come into the light?&nbsp; And indeed it was
an interesting moment when, after we had entered her house, she
blew the embers on the hearth, and <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>lighted a
candle to assist us in taking the luggage out of the car.&nbsp;
Her husband presently arrived, and he and William took the horse
to the public-house.&nbsp; The poor woman hung the kettle over
the fire.&nbsp; We had tea and sugar of our own, and she set
before us barley cakes, and milk which she had just brought in; I
recollect she said she &lsquo;had been west to fetch
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Highlanders always direct you by east and
west, north and south&mdash;very confusing to strangers.&nbsp;
She told us that it was her business to &lsquo;keep the
gate&rsquo; for Mr. ---, who lived at --- just below,&mdash;that
is, to receive messages, take in letters, etc.&nbsp; Her cottage
stood by the side of the road leading to his house, within the
gate, having, as we saw in the morning, a dressed-up
porter&rsquo;s lodge outside; but within was nothing but the
naked walls, unplastered, and floors of mud, as in the common
huts.&nbsp; She said that they lived rent-free in return for
their services; but spoke of her place and Mr. --- with little
respect, hinting that he was very proud; and indeed her
appearance, and subdued manners, and that soft voice which had
prepossessed us so much in her favour, seemed to belong to an
injured and oppressed being.&nbsp; We talked a great deal with
her, and gathered some interesting facts from her conversation,
which I wish I had written down while they were fresh in my
memory.&nbsp; They had only one child, yet seemed to be very
poor, not discontented but languid, and willing to suffer rather
than rouse to any effort.&nbsp; Though it was plain she despised
and hated her master, and had no wish to conceal it, she hardly
appeared to think it worth while to speak ill of him.&nbsp; We
were obliged to sit up very late while our kind hostess was
preparing our beds.&nbsp; William lay upon the floor on some hay,
without sheets; my bed was of chaff; I had plenty of <!-- page
207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>covering, and a pair of very nice strong clean
sheets,&mdash;she said with some pride that she had good
linen.&nbsp; I believe the sheets had been of her own spinning,
perhaps when she was first married, or before, and she probably
will keep them to the end of her life of poverty.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>September</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Before
breakfast we walked to the Pass of Killicrankie.&nbsp; A very
fine scene; the river Garry forcing its way down a deep chasm
between rocks, at the foot of high rugged hills covered with
wood, to a great height.&nbsp; The Pass did not, however, impress
us with awe, or a sensation of difficulty or danger, according to
our expectations; but, the road being at a considerable height on
the side of the hill, we at first only looked into the dell or
chasm.&nbsp; It is much grander seen from below, near the
river&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp; Everybody knows that this Pass is famous
in military history.&nbsp; When we were travelling in Scotland an
invasion was hourly looked for, and one could not but think with
some regret of the times when from the now depopulated Highlands
forty or fifty thousand men might have been poured down for the
defence of the country, under such leaders as the Marquis of
Montrose or the brave man who had so distinguished himself upon
the ground where we were standing.&nbsp; I will transcribe a
sonnet suggested to William by this place, and written in October
1803:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Six thousand Veterans practised in War&rsquo;s
game,<br />
Tried men, at Killicrankie were array&rsquo;d<br />
Against an equal host that wore the Plaid,<br />
Shepherds and herdsmen.&nbsp; Like a whirlwind came<br />
The Highlanders; the slaughter spread like flame,<br />
<!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>And Garry, thundering down his mountain road,<br />
Was stopp&rsquo;d, and could not breathe beneath the load<br />
Of the dead bodies.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a day of shame<br />
For them whom precept and the pedantry<br />
Of cold mechanic battle do enslave.<br />
Oh! for a single hour of that Dundee<br />
Who on that day the word of onset gave:<br />
Like conquest might the men of England see,<br />
And her Foes find a like inglorious grave.</p>
<p>We turned back again, and going down the hill below the Pass,
crossed the same bridge we had come over the night before, and
walked through Lady Perth&rsquo;s grounds by the side of the
Garry till we came to the Tummel, and then walked up to the
cascade of the Tummel.&nbsp; The fall is inconsiderable, scarcely
more than an ordinary &lsquo;wear;&rsquo; but it makes a loud
roaring over large stones, and the whole scene is
grand&mdash;hills, mountains, woods, and rocks.&nbsp; --- is a
very pretty place, all but the house.&nbsp; Stoddart&rsquo;s
print gives no notion of it.&nbsp; The house stands upon a small
plain at the junction of the two rivers, a close deep spot,
surrounded by high hills and woods.&nbsp; After we had
breakfasted William fetched the car, and, while we were conveying
the luggage to the outside of the gate, where it stood, Mr. ---,
<i>mal apropos</i>, came very near to the door, called the woman
out, and railed at her in the most abusive manner for
&lsquo;harbouring&rsquo; people in that way.&nbsp; She soon
slipped from him, and came back to us: I wished that William
should go and speak to her master, for I was afraid that he might
turn the poor woman away; but she would not suffer it, for she
did not care whether they stayed or not.&nbsp; In the meantime,
Mr. --- continued scolding her <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>husband;
indeed, he appeared to be not only proud, but very ignorant,
insolent, and low-bred.&nbsp; The woman told us that she had
sometimes lodged poor travellers who were passing along the road,
and permitted others to cook their victuals in her house, for
which Mr. --- had reprimanded her before; but, as she said, she
did not value her place, and it was no matter.&nbsp; In sounding
forth the dispraise of Mr. ---, I ought not to omit mentioning
that the poor woman had great delight in talking of the excellent
qualities of his mother, with whom she had been a servant, and
lived many years.&nbsp; After having interchanged good wishes we
parted with our charitable hostess, who, telling us her name,
entreated us, if ever we came that way again, to inquire for
her.</p>
<p>We travelled down the Tummel till it is lost in the Tay, and
then, in the same direction, continued our course along the vale
of Tay, which is very wide for a considerable way, but gradually
narrows, and the river, always a fine stream, assumes more
dignity and importance.&nbsp; Two or three miles before we
reached Dunkeld, we observed whole hill-sides, the property of
the Duke of Athol, planted with fir-trees till they are lost
among the rocks near the tops of the hills.&nbsp; In forty or
fifty years these plantations will be very fine, being carried
from hill to hill, and not bounded by a visible artificial
fence.</p>
<p>Reached Dunkeld at about three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is a
pretty, small town, with a respectable and rather large ruined
abbey, which is greatly injured by being made the nest of a
modern Scotch kirk, with sash windows,&mdash;very incongruous
with the noble antique tower,&mdash;a practice which we
afterwards found is not uncommon in Scotland.&nbsp; Sent for the
Duke&rsquo;s gardener after dinner, and walked with him into <!--
page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>the pleasure-grounds, intending to go to the Falls of
the Bran, a mountain stream which here joins the Tay.&nbsp; After
walking some time on a shaven turf under the shade of old trees,
by the side of the Tay, we left the pleasure-grounds, and
crossing the river by a ferry, went up a lane on the hill
opposite till we came to a locked gate by the road-side, through
which we entered into another part of the Duke&rsquo;s
pleasure-grounds bordering on the Bran, the glen being for a
considerable way&mdash;for aught I know, two miles&mdash;thridded
by gravel walks.&nbsp; The walks are quaintly enough intersected,
here and there by a baby garden of fine flowers among the rocks
and stones.&nbsp; The waterfall, which we came to see, warned us
by a loud roaring that we must expect it; we were first, however,
conducted into a small apartment, where the gardener desired us
to look at a painting of the figure of Ossian, which, while he
was telling us the story of the young artist who performed the
work, disappeared, parting in the middle, flying asunder as if by
the touch of magic, and lo! we are at the entrance of a splendid
room, which was almost dizzy and alive with waterfalls, that
tumbled in all directions&mdash;the great cascade, which was
opposite to the window that faced us, being reflected in
innumerable mirrors upon the ceiling and against the walls. <a
name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210"
class="citation">[210]</a>&nbsp; We both laughed heartily, which,
no doubt, the gardener considered as high commendation; for he
was very eloquent in pointing out the beauties of the place.</p>
<p>We left the Bran, and pursued our walk through the
plantations, where we readily forgave the Duke his little devices
for their sakes.&nbsp; They are already no insignificant woods,
where the trees happen to be oaks, birches, and others natural to
the soil; and under their shade the walks <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>are
delightful.&nbsp; From one hill, through different openings under
the trees, we looked up the vale of Tay to a great distance, a
magnificent prospect at that time of the evening; woody and
rich&mdash;corn, green fields, and cattle, the winding Tay, and
distant mountains.&nbsp; Looked down the river to the town of
Dunkeld, which lies low, under irregular hills, covered with wood
to their rocky summits, and bounded by higher mountains, which
are bare.&nbsp; The hill of Birnam, no longer Birnam
&lsquo;wood,&rsquo; was pointed out to us.&nbsp; After a very
long walk we parted from our guide when it was almost dark, and
he promised to call on us in the morning to conduct us to the
gardens.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>September</i> 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;According to
appointment, the gardener came with his keys in his hand, and we
attended him whithersoever he chose to lead, in spite of past
experience at Blair.&nbsp; We had, however, no reason to repent,
for we were repaid for the trouble of going through the large
gardens by the apples and pears of which he gave us liberally,
and the walks through the woods on that part of the grounds
opposite to where we had been the night before were very
delightful.&nbsp; The Duke&rsquo;s house is neither large nor
grand, being just an ordinary gentleman&rsquo;s house, upon a
green lawn, and whitewashed, I believe.&nbsp; The old abbey faces
the house on the east side, and appears to stand upon the same
green lawn, which, though close to the town, is entirely excluded
from it by high walls and trees.</p>
<p>We had been undetermined respecting our future course when we
came to Dunkeld, whether to go on directly to Perth and
Edinburgh, or to make a circuit and revisit the Trossachs.&nbsp;
We decided upon the latter plan, and accordingly after breakfast
set forward towards Crieff, where we <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>intended to
sleep, and the next night at Callander.&nbsp; The first part of
our road, after having crossed the ferry, was up the glen of the
Bran.&nbsp; Looking backwards, we saw Dunkeld very pretty under
the hills, and surrounded by rich cultivated ground, but we had
not a good distant view of the abbey.</p>
<p>Left our car, and went about a hundred yards from the road to
see the Rumbling Brig, which, though well worth our going out of
the way even much further, disappointed us, as places in general
do which we hear much spoken of as savage, tremendous,
etc.,&mdash;and no wonder, for they are usually described by
people to whom rocks are novelties.&nbsp; The gardener had told
us that we should pass through the most populous glen in
Scotland, the glen of Amulree.&nbsp; It is not populous in the
usual way, with scattered dwellings; but many clusters of houses,
hamlets such as we had passed near the Tummel, which had a
singular appearance, being like small encampments, were generally
without trees, and in high situations&mdash;every house the same
as its neighbour, whether for men or cattle.&nbsp; There was
nothing else remarkable in the glen.&nbsp; We halted at a lonely
inn at the foot of a steep barren moor, which we had to cross;
then, after descending considerably, came to the narrow glen,
which we had approached with no little curiosity, not having been
able to procure any distinct description of it.</p>
<p>At Dunkeld, when we were hesitating what road to take, we
wished to know whether that glen would be worth visiting, and
accordingly put several questions to the waiter, and, among other
epithets used in the course of interrogation, we stumbled upon
the word &lsquo;grand,&rsquo; to which he replied, &lsquo;No, I
do not think there are any gentlemen&rsquo;s seats in
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, we drew enough from this describer <!--
page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>and the gardener to determine us finally to go to
Callander, the Narrow Glen being in the way.</p>
<p>Entered the glen at a small hamlet at some distance from the
head, and turning aside a few steps, ascended a hillock which
commanded a view to the top of it&mdash;a very sweet scene, a
green valley, not very narrow, with a few scattered trees and
huts, almost invisible in a misty gleam of afternoon light.&nbsp;
At this hamlet we crossed a bridge, and the road led us down the
glen, which had become exceedingly narrow, and so continued to
the end: the hills on both sides heathy and rocky, very steep,
but continuous; the rocks not single or overhanging, not scooped
into caverns or sounding with torrents: there are no trees, no
houses, no traces of cultivation, not one outstanding
object.&nbsp; It is truly a solitude, the road even making it
appear still more so: the bottom of the valley is mostly smooth
and level, the brook not noisy: everything is simple and
undisturbed, and while we passed through it the whole place was
shady, cool, clear, and solemn.&nbsp; At the end of the long
valley we ascended a hill to a great height, and reached the top,
when the sun, on the point of setting, shed a soft yellow light
upon every eminence.&nbsp; The prospect was very extensive; over
hollows and plains, no towns, and few houses visible&mdash;a
prospect, extensive as it was, in harmony with the secluded dell,
and fixing its own peculiar character of removedness from the
world, and the secure possession of the quiet of nature more
deeply in our minds.&nbsp; The following poem was written by
William on hearing of a tradition relating to it, which we did
not know when we were there:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">In this still place remote from men<br />
Sleeps Ossian, in the Narrow Glen,<br />
<!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>In this still place where murmurs on<br />
But one meek streamlet, only one.<br />
He sung of battles and the breath<br />
Of stormy war, and violent death,<br />
And should, methinks, when all was pass&rsquo;d,<br />
Have rightfully been laid at last<br />
Where rocks were rudely heap&rsquo;d, and rent<br />
As by a spirit turbulent;<br />
Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild,<br />
And everything unreconciled,<br />
In some complaining, dim retreat<br />
Where fear and melancholy meet;<br />
But this is calm; there cannot be<br />
A more entire tranquillity.</p>
<p class="poetry">Does then the bard sleep here indeed?<br />
Or is it but a groundless creed?<br />
What matters it?&nbsp; I blame them not<br />
Whose fancy in this lonely spot<br />
Was moved, and in this way express&rsquo;d<br />
Their notion of its perfect rest.<br />
A convent, even a hermit&rsquo;s cell<br />
Would break the silence of this Dell;<br />
It is not quiet, is not ease,<br />
But something deeper far than these;<br />
The separation that is here<br />
Is of the grave; and of austere<br />
And happy feelings of the dead:<br />
And therefore was it rightly said<br />
That Ossian, last of all his race,<br />
Lies buried in this lonely place.</p>
<p>Having descended into a broad cultivated vale, we saw <!--
page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>nothing remarkable.&nbsp; Observed a gentleman&rsquo;s
house, <a name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a> which stood pleasantly among
trees.&nbsp; It was dark some time before we reached Crieff, a
small town, though larger than Dunkeld.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>September</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rose
early, and departed without breakfast.&nbsp; We were to pass
through one of the most celebrated vales of Scotland, Strath
Erne.&nbsp; We found it a wide, long, and irregular vale, with
many gentlemen&rsquo;s seats under the hills, woods, copses,
frequent cottages, plantations, and much cultivation, yet with an
intermixture of barren ground; indeed, except at Killin and
Dunkeld, there was always something which seemed to take from the
composure and simplicity of the cultivated scenes.&nbsp; There is
a struggle to overcome the natural barrenness, and the end not
attained, an appearance of something doing or imperfectly done, a
passing with labour from one state of society into another.&nbsp;
When you look from an eminence on the fields of Grasmere Vale,
the heart is satisfied with a simple undisturbed pleasure, and no
less, on one of the green or heathy dells of Scotland, where
there is no appearance of change to be, or having been, but such
as the seasons make.&nbsp; Strath Erne is so extensive a vale
that, had it been in England, there must have been much
inequality, as in Wensley Dale; but at Wensley there is a unity,
a softness, a melting together, which in the large vales of
Scotland I never perceived.&nbsp; The difference at Strath Erne
may come partly from the irregularity, the undefined outline, of
the hills which enclose it; but it is caused still more by the
broken surface, I mean broken as to colour and produce, the want
of hedgerows, and also the great number of new fir
plantations.&nbsp; After some miles it <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>becomes
much narrower as we approach nearer the mountains at the foot of
the lake of the same name, Loch Erne.</p>
<p>Breakfasted at a small public-house, a wretchedly dirty
cottage, but the people were civil, and though we had nothing but
barley cakes we made a good breakfast, for there were plenty of
eggs.&nbsp; Walked up a high hill to view the seat of Mr. Dundas,
now Lord Melville&mdash;a spot where, if he have gathered much
wisdom from his late disgrace or his long intercourse with the
world, he may spend his days as quietly as he need desire.&nbsp;
It is a secluded valley, not rich, but with plenty of wood: there
are many pretty paths through the woods, and moss huts in
different parts.&nbsp; After leaving the cottage where we
breakfasted the country was very pleasing, yet still with a want
of richness; but this was less perceived, being huddled up in
charcoal woods, and the vale narrow.&nbsp; Loch Erne opens out in
a very pleasing manner, seen from a hill along which the road is
carried through a wood of low trees; but it does not improve
afterwards, lying directly from east to west without any
perceivable bendings: and the shores are not much broken or
varied, not populous, and the mountains not sufficiently
commanding to make up for the deficiencies.&nbsp; Dined at the
head of the lake.&nbsp; I scarcely know its length, but should
think not less than four or five miles, and it is wide in
proportion.&nbsp; The inn is in a small village&mdash;a decent
house.</p>
<p>Walked about half a mile along the road to Tyndrum, which is
through a bare glen, <a name="citation216"></a><a
href="#footnote216" class="citation">[216]</a> and over a
mountain pass.&nbsp; It rained when we pursued our journey again,
and continued to rain for several hours.&nbsp; The road which we
were to take was up another glen, down which came a stream <!--
page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>that fell into the lake on the opposite side at the
head of it, so, after having crossed the main vale, a little
above the lake, we entered into the smaller glen.&nbsp; The road
delightfully smooth and dry&mdash;one gentleman&rsquo;s house
very pleasant among large coppice woods.&nbsp; After going
perhaps three miles up this valley, we turned to the left into
another, which seemed to be much more beautiful.&nbsp; It was a
level valley, not&mdash;like that which we had passed&mdash;a
wide sloping cleft between the hills, but having a quiet,
slow-paced stream, which flowed through level green grounds
tufted with trees intermingled with cottages.&nbsp; The tops of
the hills were hidden by mists, and the objects in the valley
seen through misty rain, which made them look exceedingly soft,
and indeed partly concealed them, and we always fill up what we
are left to guess at with something as beautiful as what we
see.&nbsp; This valley seemed to have less of the appearance of
barrenness or imperfect cultivation than any of the same
character we had passed through; indeed, we could not discern any
traces of it.&nbsp; It is called Strath Eyer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Strath&rsquo; is generally applied to a broad vale; but
this, though open, is not broad.</p>
<p>We next came to a lake, called Loch Lubnaig, a name which
signifies &lsquo;winding.&rsquo;&nbsp; In shape it somewhat
resembles Ulswater, but is much narrower and shorter, being only
four miles in length.&nbsp; The character of this lake is simple
and grand.&nbsp; On the side opposite to where we were is a range
of steep craggy mountains, one of which&mdash;like Place
Fell&mdash;encroaching upon the bed of the lake, forces it to
make a considerable bending.&nbsp; I have forgotten the name of
this precipice: it is a very remarkable one, being almost
perpendicular, and very rugged.</p>
<p>We, on the other side, travelled under steep and rocky <!--
page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>hills which were often covered with low woods to a
considerable height; there were one or two farm-houses, and a few
cottages.&nbsp; A neat white dwelling <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a> on the side of the hill over against
the bold steep of which I have spoken, had been the residence of
the famous traveller Bruce, who, all his travels ended, had
arranged the history of them in that solitude&mdash;as deep as
any Abyssinian one&mdash;among the mountains of his native
country, where he passed several years.&nbsp; Whether he died
there or not we did not learn; but the manner of his death was
remarkable and affecting,&mdash;from a fall down-stairs in his
own house, after so many dangers through which fortitude and
courage had never failed to sustain him.&nbsp; The house stands
sweetly, surrounded by coppice-woods and green fields.&nbsp; On
the other side, I believe, were no houses till we came near to
the outlet, where a few low huts looked very beautiful, with
their dark brown roofs near a stream which hurried down the
mountain, and after its turbulent course travelled a short way
over a level green, and was lost in the lake.</p>
<p>Within a few miles of Callander we come into a grand region;
the mountains to a considerable height were covered with wood,
enclosing us in a narrow passage; the stream on our right,
generally concealed by wood, made a loud roaring; at one place,
in particular, it fell down the rocks in a succession of
cascades.&nbsp; The scene is much celebrated in Scotland, and is
called the Pass of Leny.&nbsp; It was nearly dark when we reached
Callander.&nbsp; We were wet and cold, and glad of a good
fire.&nbsp; The inn was comfortable; we drank tea; and after tea
the waiter presented us with a pamphlet descriptive of the
neighbourhood of Callander, which we brought away with us, and I
am very sorry I lost it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>FIFTH WEEK.</h2>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>September</i> 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Immediately
after breakfast, the morning being fine, we set off with cheerful
spirits towards the Trossachs, intending to take up our lodging
at the house of our old friend the ferryman.&nbsp; A boy
accompanied us to convey the horse and car back to Callander from
the head of Loch Achray.&nbsp; The country near Callander is very
pleasing; but, as almost everywhere else, imperfectly
cultivated.&nbsp; We went up a broad vale, through which runs the
stream from Loch Ketterine, and came to Loch Vennachar, a larger
lake than Loch Achray, the small one which had given us such
unexpected delight when we left the Pass of the Trossachs.&nbsp;
Loch Vennachar is much larger, but greatly inferior in beauty to
the image which we had conceived of its neighbour, and so the
reality proved to us when we came up to that little lake, and saw
it before us in its true shape in the cheerful sunshine.&nbsp;
The Trossachs, overtopped by Benledi and other high mountains,
enclose the lake at the head; and those houses which we had seen
before, with their corn fields sloping towards the water, stood
very prettily under low woods.&nbsp; The fields did not appear so
rich as when we had seen them through the veil of mist; but yet,
as in framing our expectations we had allowed for a much greater
difference, so we were even a second time surprised with pleasure
at the same spot.</p>
<p>Went as far as these houses of which I have spoken in <!--
page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>the car, and then walked on, intending to pursue the
road up the side of Loch Ketterine along which Coleridge had
come; but we had resolved to spend some hours in the
neighbourhood of the Trossachs, and accordingly coasted the head
of Loch Achray, and pursued the brook between the two lakes as
far as there was any track.&nbsp; Here we found, to our
surprise&mdash;for we had expected nothing but heath and rocks
like the rest of the neighbourhood of the Trossachs&mdash;a
secluded farm, a plot of verdant ground with a single cottage and
its company of out-houses.&nbsp; We turned back, and went to the
very point from which we had first looked upon Loch Achray when
we were here with Coleridge.&nbsp; It was no longer a visionary
scene: the sun shone into every crevice of the hills, and the
mountain-tops were clear.&nbsp; After some time we went into the
pass from the Trossachs, and were delighted to behold the forms
of objects fully revealed, and even surpassing in loveliness and
variety what we had conceived.&nbsp; The mountains, I think,
appeared not so high; but on the whole we had not the smallest
disappointment; the heather was fading, though still
beautiful.</p>
<p>Sate for half-an-hour in Lady Perth&rsquo;s shed, and
scrambled over the rocks and through the thickets at the head of
the lake.&nbsp; I went till I could make my way no further, and
left William to go to the top of the hill, whence he had a
distinct view, as on a map, of the intricacies of the lake and
the course of the river.&nbsp; Returned to the huts, and, after
having taken a second dinner of the food we had brought from
Callander, set our faces towards the head of Loch
Ketterine.&nbsp; I can add nothing to my former description of
the Trossachs, except that we departed with our old delightful
remembrances endeared, and many new ones.&nbsp; <!-- page
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>The path or road&mdash;for it was neither the one nor
the other, but something between both&mdash;is the pleasantest I
have ever travelled in my life for the same length of
way,&mdash;now with marks of sledges or wheels, or none at all,
bare or green, as it might happen; now a little descent, now a
level; sometimes a shady lane, at others an open track through
green pastures; then again it would lead us into thick
coppice-woods, which often entirely shut out the lake, and again
admitted it by glimpses.&nbsp; We have never had a more
delightful walk than this evening.&nbsp; Ben Lomond and the three
pointed-topped mountains of Loch Lomond, which we had seen from
the Garrison, were very majestic under the clear sky, the lake
perfectly calm, the air sweet and mild.&nbsp; I felt that it was
much more interesting to visit a place where we have been before
than it can possibly be the first time, except under peculiar
circumstances.&nbsp; The sun had been set for some time, when,
being within a quarter of a mile of the ferryman&rsquo;s hut, our
path having led us close to the shore of the calm lake, we met
two neatly dressed women, without hats, who had probably been
taking their Sunday evening&rsquo;s walk.&nbsp; One of them said
to us in a friendly, soft tone of voice, &lsquo;What! you are
stepping westward?&rsquo;&nbsp; I cannot describe how affecting
this simple expression was in that remote place, with the western
sky in front, yet glowing with the departed sun.&nbsp; William
wrote the following poem long after, in remembrance of his
feelings and mine:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;What! you are stepping
westward?&rsquo;&nbsp; Yea,<br />
&rsquo;Twould be a wildish destiny<br />
If we, who thus together roam<br />
In a strange land, and far from home,<br />
<!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>Were in this place the guests of chance:<br />
Yet who would stop, or fear to advance,<br />
Though home or shelter he had none,<br />
With such a sky to lead him on?</p>
<p class="poetry">The dewy ground was dark and cold,<br />
Behind all gloomy to behold,<br />
And stepping westward seem&rsquo;d to be<br />
A kind of heavenly destiny;<br />
I liked the greeting, &rsquo;twas a sound<br />
Of something without place or bound;<br />
And seem&rsquo;d to give me spiritual right<br />
To travel through that region bright.</p>
<p class="poetry">The voice was soft; and she who spake<br />
Was walking by her native Lake;<br />
The salutation was to me<br />
The very sound of courtesy;<br />
Its power was felt, and while my eye<br />
Was fix&rsquo;d upon the glowing sky,<br />
The echo of the voice enwrought<br />
A human sweetness with the thought<br />
Of travelling through the world that lay<br />
Before me in my endless way.</p>
<p>We went up to the door of our boatman&rsquo;s hut as to a
home, and scarcely less confident of a cordial welcome than if we
had been approaching our own cottage at Grasmere.&nbsp; It had
been a very pleasing thought, while we were walking by the side
of the beautiful lake, that, few hours as we had been there,
there was a home for us in one of its quiet dwellings.&nbsp;
Accordingly, so we found it; the good woman, who had been at a
preaching by the lake-side, was in her <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>holiday
dress at the door, and seemed to be rejoiced at the sight of
us.&nbsp; She led us into the hut in haste to supply our wants;
we took once more a refreshing meal by her fireside, and, though
not so merry as the last time, we were not less happy, bating our
regrets that Coleridge was not in his old place.&nbsp; I slept in
the same bed as before, and listened to the household stream,
which now only made a very low murmuring.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Monday</i>, <i>September</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rejoiced in
the morning to see the sun shining upon the hills when I first
looked out through the open window-place at my bed&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; We rose early, and after breakfast, our old
companion, who was to be our guide for the day, rowed us over the
water to the same point where Coleridge and I had sate down and
eaten our dinner, while William had gone to survey the unknown
coast.&nbsp; We intended to cross Loch Lomond, follow the lake to
Glenfalloch, above the head of it, and then come over the
mountains to Glengyle, and so down the glen, and passing Mr.
Macfarlane&rsquo;s house, back again to the ferry-house, where we
should sleep.&nbsp; So, a third time we went through the mountain
hollow, now familiar ground.&nbsp; The inhabitants had not yet
got in all their hay, and were at work in the fields; our guide
often stopped to talk with them, and no doubt was called upon to
answer many inquiries respecting us two strangers.</p>
<p>At the ferry-house of Inversneyde we had not the happy sight
of the Highland girl and her companion, but the good woman
received us cordially, gave me milk, and talked of Coleridge,
who, the morning after we parted from him, had been at her house
to fetch his watch, which he had forgotten two days before.&nbsp;
He has since told me <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>that he questioned her respecting
the miserable condition of her hut, which, as you may remember,
admitted the rain at the door, and retained it in the hollows of
the mud floor: he told her how easy it would be to remove these
inconveniences, and to contrive something, at least, to prevent
the wind from entering at the window-places, if not a glass
window for light and warmth by day.&nbsp; She replied that this
was very true, but if they made any improvements the laird would
conclude that they were growing rich, and would raise their
rent.</p>
<p>The ferryman happened to be just ready at the moment to go
over the lake with a poor man, his wife and child.&nbsp; The
little girl, about three years old, cried all the way, terrified
by the water.&nbsp; When we parted from this family, they going
down the lake, and we up it, I could not but think of the
difference in our condition to that poor woman, who, with her
husband, had been driven from her home by want of work, and was
now going a long journey to seek it elsewhere: every step was
painful toil, for she had either her child to bear or a heavy
burthen.&nbsp; <i>I</i> walked as she did, but pleasure was my
object, and if toil came along with it, even <i>that</i> was
pleasure,&mdash;pleasure, at least, it would be in the
remembrance.</p>
<p>We were, I believe, nine miles from Glenfalloch when we left
the boat.&nbsp; To us, with minds at ease, the walk was
delightful; it could not be otherwise, for we passed by a
continual succession of rocks, woods, and mountains; but the
houses were few, and the ground cultivated only in small portions
near the water, consequently there was not that sort of variety
which leaves distinct separate remembrances, but one impression
of solitude and greatness.&nbsp; While the Highlander and I were
plodding on together <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>side by side, interspersing long
silences with now and then a question or a remark, looking down
to the lake he espied two small rocky islands, and pointing to
them, said to me, &lsquo;It will be gay <a
name="citation225a"></a><a href="#footnote225a"
class="citation">[225a]</a> and dangerous sailing there in stormy
weather when the water is high.&rsquo;&nbsp; In giving my assent
I could not help smiling, but I afterwards found that a like
combination of words is not uncommon in Scotland, for, at
Edinburgh, William being afraid of rain, asked the ostler what he
thought, who, looking up to the sky, pronounced it to be
&lsquo;gay and dull,&rsquo; and therefore rain might be
expected.&nbsp; The most remarkable object we saw was a huge
single stone, I believe three or four times the size of Bowder
Stone. <a name="citation225b"></a><a href="#footnote225b"
class="citation">[225b]</a>&nbsp; The top of it, which on one
side was sloping like the roof of a house, was covered with
heather.&nbsp; William climbed up the rock, which would have been
no easy task but to a mountaineer, and we constructed a rope of
pocket-handkerchiefs, garters, plaids, coats, etc., and measured
its height.&nbsp; It was so many times the length of
William&rsquo;s walking-stick, but, unfortunately, having lost
the stick, we have lost the measure.&nbsp; The ferryman told us
that a preaching was held there once in three months by a certain
minister&mdash;I think of Arrochar&mdash;who engages, as a part
of his office, to perform the service.&nbsp; The interesting
feelings we had connected with the Highland Sabbath and Highland
worship returned here with double force.&nbsp; The rock, though
on one side a high perpendicular wall, in no place overhung so as
to form a shelter, in no place could it be more than a screen
from the elements.&nbsp; Why then had it been selected for such a
purpose?&nbsp; Was it merely from being a central situation and a
conspicuous <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>object?&nbsp; Or did there belong to
it some inheritance of superstition from old times?&nbsp; It is
impossible to look at the stone without asking, How came it
hither?&nbsp; Had then that obscurity and unaccountableness, that
mystery of power which is about it, any influence over the first
persons who resorted hither for worship?&nbsp; Or have they now
on those who continue to frequent it?&nbsp; The lake is in front
of the perpendicular wall, and behind, at some distance, and
totally detached from it, is the continuation of the ridge of
mountains which forms the vale of Loch Lomond&mdash;a magnificent
temple, of which this spot is a noble Sanctum Sanctorum.</p>
<p>We arrived at Glenfalloch at about one or two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is no village; there being only scattered
huts in the glen, which may be four miles long, according to my
remembrance: the middle of it is very green, and level, and
tufted with trees.&nbsp; Higher up, where the glen parts into two
very narrow ones, is the house of the laird; I daresay a pretty
place.&nbsp; The view from the door of the public-house is
exceedingly beautiful; the river flows smoothly into the lake,
and the fields were at that time as green as possible.&nbsp;
Looking backward, Ben Lomond very majestically shuts in the
view.&nbsp; The top of the mountain, as seen here, being of a
pyramidal form, it is much grander than with the broken outline,
and stage above stage, as seen from the neighbourhood of
Luss.&nbsp; We found nobody at home at the inn, but the ferryman
shouted, wishing to have a glass of whisky, and a young woman
came from the hay-field, dressed in a white bed-gown, without hat
or cap.&nbsp; There was no whisky in the house, so he begged a
little whey to drink with the fragments of our cold meat brought
from Callander.&nbsp; After a <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>short rest
in a cool parlour we set forward again, having to cross the river
and climb up a steep mountain on the opposite side of the
valley.&nbsp; I observed that the people were busy bringing in
the hay before it was dry into a sort of &lsquo;fauld&rsquo; or
yard, where they intended to leave it, ready to be gathered into
the house with the first threatening of rain, and if not
completely dry brought out again.&nbsp; Our guide bore me in his
arms over the stream, and we soon came to the foot of the
mountain.&nbsp; The most easy rising, for a short way at first,
was near a naked rivulet which made a fine cascade in one
place.&nbsp; Afterwards, the ascent was very laborious, being
frequently almost perpendicular.</p>
<p>It is one of those moments which I shall not easily forget,
when at that point from which a step or two would have carried us
out of sight of the green fields of Glenfalloch, being at a great
height on the mountain, we sate down, and heard, as if from the
heart of the earth, the sound of torrents ascending out of the
long hollow glen.&nbsp; To the eye all was motionless, a perfect
stillness.&nbsp; The noise of waters did not appear to come this
way or that, from any particular quarter: it was everywhere,
almost, one might say, as if &lsquo;exhaled&rsquo; through the
whole surface of the green earth.&nbsp; Glenfalloch, Coleridge
has since told me, signifies the Hidden Vale; but William says,
if we were to name it from our recollections of that time, we
should call it the Vale of Awful Sound.&nbsp; We continued to
climb higher and higher; but the hill was no longer steep, and
afterwards we pursued our way along the top of it with many small
ups and downs.&nbsp; The walk was very laborious after the
climbing was over, being often exceedingly stony, or through
swampy moss, rushes, or rough heather.&nbsp; As we <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>proceeded, continuing our way at the top of the
mountain, encircled by higher mountains at a great distance, we
were passing, without notice, a heap of scattered stones round
which was a belt of green grass&mdash;green, and as it seemed
rich, where all else was either poor heather and coarse grass, or
unprofitable rushes and spongy moss.&nbsp; The Highlander made a
pause, saying, &lsquo;This place is much changed since I was here
twenty years ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; He told us that the heap of stones
had been a hut where a family was then living, who had their
winter habitation in the valley, and brought their goats thither
in the summer to feed on the mountains, and that they were used
to gather them together at night and morning to be milked close
to the door, which was the reason why the grass was yet so green
near the stones.&nbsp; It was affecting in that solitude to meet
with this memorial of manners passed away; we looked about for
some other traces of humanity, but nothing else could we find in
that place.&nbsp; We ourselves afterwards espied another of those
ruins, much more extensive&mdash;the remains, as the man told us,
of several dwellings.&nbsp; We were astonished at the sagacity
with which our Highlander discovered the track, where often no
track was visible to us, and scarcely even when he pointed it
out.&nbsp; It reminded us of what we read of the Hottentots and
other savages.&nbsp; He went on as confidently as if it had been
a turnpike road&mdash;the more surprising, as when he was there
before it must have been a plain track, for he told us that
fishermen from Arrochar carried herrings regularly over the
mountains by that way to Loch Ketterine when the glens were much
more populous than now.</p>
<p>Descended into Glengyle, above Loch Ketterine, and passed
through Mr. Macfarlane&rsquo;s grounds, that is, through <!--
page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>the whole of the glen, where there was now no house
left but his.&nbsp; We stopped at his door to inquire after the
family, though with little hope of finding them at home, having
seen a large company at work in a hay field, whom we conjectured
to be his whole household&mdash;as it proved, except a
servant-maid, who answered our inquiries.&nbsp; We had sent the
ferryman forward from the head of the glen to bring the boat
round from the place where he left it to the other side of the
lake.&nbsp; Passed the same farm-house we had such good reason to
remember, and went up to the burying-ground that stood so sweetly
near the water-side.&nbsp; The ferryman had told us that Rob
Roy&rsquo;s grave was there, <a name="citation229"></a><a
href="#footnote229" class="citation">[229]</a> so we could not
pass on without going up to the spot.&nbsp; There were several
tomb-stones, but the inscriptions were either worn-out or
unintelligible to us, and the place choked up with nettles and
brambles.&nbsp; You will remember the description I have given of
the spot.&nbsp; I have nothing here to add, except the following
poem which it suggested to William:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">A famous Man is Robin Hood,<br />
The English Ballad-singer&rsquo;s joy,<br />
And Scotland boasts of one as good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She has her own Rob Roy!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then clear the weeds from off his grave,<br />
And let us chaunt a passing stave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In honour of that Outlaw brave.</p>
<p class="poetry">Heaven gave Rob Roy a daring heart<br />
And wondrous length and strength of arm,<br />
Nor craved he more to quell his foes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or keep his friends from harm.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Yet Robin was as wise as brave,<br
/>
As wise in thought as bold in deed,<br />
For in the principles of things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He sought his moral creed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Said generous Rob, &lsquo;What need of
books?<br />
Burn all the statutes and their shelves:<br />
They stir us up against our kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And worse, against ourselves.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;We have a passion; make a law,<br />
Too false to guide us or control:<br />
And for the law itself we fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In bitterness of soul.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;And puzzled, blinded thus, we lose<br />
Distinctions that are plain and few:<br />
These find I graven on my heart:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That tells me what to do.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The Creatures see of flood and field,<br

And those that travel on the wind!<br />
With them no strife can last; they live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In peace, and peace of mind.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;For why?&nbsp; Because the good old
rule<br />
Suffices them, the simple plan<br />
That they should take who have the power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they should keep who can.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;A lesson which is quickly
learn&rsquo;d,<br />
A signal this which all can see!<br />
Thus nothing here provokes the strong<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To tyrannous cruelty.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span

check&rsquo;d;<br />
He tamed who foolishly aspires,<br />
While to the measure of their might<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All fashion their desires.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;All kinds and creatures stand and
fall<br />
By strength of prowess or of wit,<br />
&rsquo;Tis God&rsquo;s appointment who must sway,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And who is to submit.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Since then,&rsquo; said Robin,
&lsquo;right is plain,<br />
And longest life is but a day;<br />
To have my ends, maintain my rights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take the shortest way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And thus among these rocks he lived<br />
Through summer&rsquo;s heat and winter&rsquo;s snow;<br />
The Eagle, he was lord above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Rob was lord below.</p>
<p class="poetry">So was it&mdash;would at least have been<br />
But through untowardness of fate;<br />
For polity was then too strong:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He came an age too late.</p>
<p class="poetry">Or shall we say an age too soon?<br />
For were the bold man living now,<br />
How might he flourish in his pride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With buds on every bough?</p>
<p class="poetry">Then Rents and Land-marks, Rights of chase,<br

Sheriffs and Factors, Lairds and Thanes,<br />
Would all have seem&rsquo;d but paltry things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not worth a moment&rsquo;s pains.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span

here,<br />
To these few meagre vales confined,<br />
But thought how wide the world, the times<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How fairly to his mind.</p>
<p class="poetry">And to his Sword he would have said,<br />
&lsquo;Do thou my sovereign will enact<br />
From land to land through half the earth;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Judge thou of law and fact.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis fit that we should do our
part;<br />
Becoming that mankind should learn<br />
That we are not to be surpass&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In fatherly concern.</p>

Of good things none are good enough;<br />
I&rsquo;ll shew that I can help to frame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A world of other stuff.</p>

From me the sign of life and death,<br />
Kingdoms shall shift about like clouds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Obedient to my breath.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And if the word had been fulfill&rsquo;d<br />
As might have been, then, thought of joy!<br />
France would have had her present Boast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we our brave Rob Roy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! say not so, compare them not;<br />

Are faces that attest the same;<br />
Kindling with instantaneous joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At sound of Rob Roy&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Soon after we saw our boat coming over the calm water.&nbsp;
It was late in the evening, and I was stiff and weary, as well I
might, after such a long and toilsome walk, so it was no poor
gratification to sit down and be conscious of advancing in our
journey without further labour.&nbsp; The stars were beginning to
appear, but the brightness of the west was not yet
gone;&mdash;the lake perfectly still, and when we first went into
the boat we rowed almost close to the shore <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>under steep
crags hung with birches: it was like a new-discovered country of
which we had not dreamed, for in walking down the lake, owing to
the road in that part being carried at a considerable height on
the hill-side, the rocks and the indentings of the shore had been
hidden from us.&nbsp; At this time, those rocks and their images
in the calm water composed one mass, the surfaces of both equally
distinct, except where the water trembled with the motion of our
boat.&nbsp; Having rowed a while under the bold steeps, we
launched out further when the shores were no longer abrupt.&nbsp;
We hardly spoke to each other as we moved along receding from the
west, which diffused a solemn animation over the lake.&nbsp; The
sky was cloudless; and everything seemed at rest except our
solitary boat, and the mountain-streams,&mdash;seldom heard, and
but faintly.&nbsp; I think I have rarely experienced a more
elevated pleasure than during our short voyage of this
night.&nbsp; The good woman had long been looking out for us, and
had prepared everything for our refreshment; and as soon as we
had finished supper, or rather tea, we went to bed.&nbsp;
William, I doubt not, rested well, and, for my part, I slept as
soundly on my chaff bed as ever I have done in childhood after
the long day&rsquo;s playing of a summer&rsquo;s holiday.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 13<i>th</i> <i>September</i>.&mdash;Again a
fine morning.&nbsp; I strolled into the green field in which the
house stands while the woman was preparing breakfast, and at my
return found one of her neighbours sitting by the fire, a feeble
paralytic old woman.&nbsp; After having inquired concerning our
journey the day before, she said, &lsquo;I have travelled far in
my time,&rsquo; and told me she had married an English soldier
who had been stationed at the Garrison; they had had <!-- page
235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>many children, who were all dead or in foreign
countries; and she had returned to her native place, where now
she had lived several years, and was more comfortable than she
could ever have expected to be, being very kindly dealt with by
all her neighbours.&nbsp; Pointing to the ferryman and his wife,
she said they were accustomed to give her a day of their labour
in digging peats, in common with others, and in that manner she
was provided with fuel, and, by like voluntary contributions,
with other necessaries.&nbsp; While this infirm old woman was
relating her story in a tremulous voice, I could not but think of
the changes of things, and the days of her youth, when the shrill
fife, sounding from the walls of the Garrison, made a merry noise
through the echoing hills.&nbsp; I asked myself, if she were to
be carried again to the deserted spot after her course of life,
no doubt a troublesome one, would the silence appear to her the
silence of desolation or of peace?</p>
<p>After breakfast we took a final leave of our hostess, and,
attended by her husband, again set forward on foot.&nbsp; My
limbs were a little stiff, but the morning being uncommonly fine
I did not fear to aim at the accomplishment of a plan we had laid
of returning to Callander by a considerable circuit.&nbsp; We
were to go over the mountains from Loch Ketterine, a little below
the ferry-house on the same side of the water, descending to Loch
Voil, a lake from which issues the stream that flows through
Strath Eyer into Loch Lubnaig.&nbsp; Our road, as is generally
the case in passing from one vale into another, was through a
settling between the hills, not far from a small stream.&nbsp; We
had to climb considerably, the mountain being much higher than it
appears to be, owing to its retreating in what looks like a
gradual slope from the lake, though we found it steep <!-- page
236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>enough in the climbing.&nbsp; Our guide had been born
near Loch Voil, and he told us that at the head of the lake, if
we would look about for it, we should see the burying-place of a
part of his family, the MacGregors, a clan who had long possessed
that district, a circumstance which he related with no unworthy
pride of ancestry.&nbsp; We shook hands with him at parting, not
without a hope of again entering his hut in company with others
whom we loved.</p>
<p>Continued to walk for some time along the top of the hill,
having the high mountains of Loch Voil before us, and Ben Lomond
and the steeps of Loch Ketterine behind.&nbsp; Came to several
deserted mountain huts or shiels, and rested for some time beside
one of them, upon a hillock of its green plot of monumental
herbage.&nbsp; William here conceived the notion of writing an
ode upon the affecting subject of those relics of human society
found in that grand and solitary region.&nbsp; The spot of ground
where we sate was even beautiful, the grass being uncommonly
verdant, and of a remarkably soft and silky texture.</p>
<p>After this we rested no more till we came to the foot of the
mountain, where there was a cottage, at the door of which a woman
invited me to drink some whey: this I did, while William went to
inquire respecting the road at a new stone house a few steps
further.&nbsp; He was told to cross the brook, and proceed to the
other side of the vale, and that no further directions were
necessary, for we should find ourselves at the head of the lake,
and on a plain road which would lead us downward.&nbsp; We waded
the river and crossed the vale, perhaps half a mile or
more.&nbsp; The mountains all round are very high; the vale
pastoral and unenclosed, not many dwellings, and but few trees;
the mountains in general smooth near the bottom.&nbsp; They are
in large <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>unbroken masses, combining with the
vale to give an impression of bold simplicity.</p>
<p>Near the head of the lake, at some distance from us, we
discovered the burial-place of the MacGregors, and did not view
it without some interest, with its ornamental balls on the four
corners of the wall, which, I daresay, have been often looked at
with elevation of heart by our honest friend of Loch
Ketterine.&nbsp; The lake is divided right across by a narrow
slip of flat land, making a small lake at the head of the large
one.&nbsp; The whole may be about five miles long.</p>
<p>As we descended, the scene became more fertile, our way being
pleasantly varied&mdash;through coppices or open fields, and
passing farm-houses, though always with an intermixture of
uncultivated ground.&nbsp; It was harvest-time, and the fields
were quietly&mdash;might I be allowed to say
pensively?&mdash;enlivened by small companies of reapers.&nbsp;
It is not uncommon in the more lonely parts of the Highlands to
see a single person so employed.&nbsp; The following poem was
suggested to William by a beautiful sentence in Thomas
Wilkinson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tour in Scotland:&rsquo; <a
name="citation237"></a><a href="#footnote237"
class="citation">[237]</a>&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Behold her single in the field,<br />
Yon solitary Highland Lass,<br />
Reaping and singing by herself&mdash;<br />
Stop here, or gently pass.<br />
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,<br />
And sings a melancholy strain.<br />
Oh! listen, for the Vale profound<br />
Is overflowing with the sound.</p>
<p class="poetry">No nightingale did ever chaunt<br />
So sweetly to reposing bands<br />
Of travellers in some shady haunt<br />
Among Arabian Sands;<br />
<!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>No sweeter voice was ever heard<br />
In spring-time from the cuckoo-bird<br />
Breaking the silence of the seas<br />
Among the farthest Hebrides.</p>
<p class="poetry">Will no one tell me what she sings?<br />
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br />
For old unhappy far-off things,<br />
And battles long ago;&mdash;<br />
Or is it some more humble lay&mdash;<br />
Familiar matter of to-day&mdash;<br />
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain<br />
That has been, and may be again?</p>
<p class="poetry">Whate&rsquo;er the theme, the Maiden sung<br />
As if her song could have no ending;<br />
I saw her singing at her work,<br />
And o&rsquo;er the sickle bending;<br />
I listen&rsquo;d till I had my fill,<br />
And as I mounted up the hill<br />
The music in my heart I bore<br />
Long after it was heard no more.</p>
<p>Towards the foot of the lake, on the opposite side, which was
more barren than that on which we travelled, was a bare road up a
steep hill, which leads to Glen Finlas, formerly a royal
forest.&nbsp; It is a wild and rocky glen, as we had been told by
a person who directed our notice to its outlet at Loch
Achray.&nbsp; The stream which passes through it falls into that
lake near the head.&nbsp; At the end of Loch Voil the vale is
wide and populous&mdash;large pastures with many cattle, large
tracts of corn.&nbsp; We walked downwards a little way, and then
crossed over to the same road along <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>which we
had travelled from Loch Erne to Callander, being once again at
the entrance of Strath Eyer.&nbsp; It might be about four or five
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon; we were ten miles from Callander,
exceedingly tired, and wished heartily for the poor horse and
car.&nbsp; Walked up Strath Eyer, and saw in clear air and
sunshine what had been concealed from us when we travelled before
in the mist and rain.&nbsp; We found it less woody and rich than
it had appeared to be, but, with all deductions, a very sweet
valley.</p>
<p>Not far from Loch Lubnaig, though not in view of it, is a long
village, with two or three public-houses, and being in despair of
reaching Callander that night without over-fatigue we resolved to
stop at the most respectable-looking house, and, should it not
prove wretched indeed, to lodge there if there were beds for us:
at any rate it was necessary to take some refreshment.&nbsp; The
woman of the house spoke with gentleness and civility, and had a
good countenance, which reconciled me to stay, though I had been
averse to the scheme, dreading the dirt usual in Scotch
public-houses by the way-side.&nbsp; She said she had beds for
us, and clean sheets, and we desired her to prepare them
immediately.&nbsp; It was a two-storied house, light built,
though in other respects no better than the huts, and&mdash;as
all the slated cottages are&mdash;much more uncomfortable in
appearance, except that there was a chimney in the kitchen.&nbsp;
At such places it is fit that travellers should make up their
minds to wait at least an hour longer than the time necessary to
prepare whatever meal they may have ordered, which we, I may
truly say, did with most temperate philosophy.&nbsp; I went to
talk with the mistress, who was making barley cakes, which she
wrought out with her hands as thin as the oaten bread we make in
Cumberland.&nbsp; I asked her why she did not <!-- page 240--><a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>use a
rolling-pin, and if it would not be much more convenient, to
which she returned me no distinct answer, and seemed to give
little attention to the question: she did not know, or that was
what they were used to, or something of the sort.&nbsp; It was a
tedious process, and I thought could scarcely have been managed
if the cakes had been as large as ours; but they are considerably
smaller, which is a great loss of time in the baking.</p>
<p>This woman, whose common language was the Gaelic, talked with
me a very good English, asking many questions, yet without the
least appearance of an obtrusive or impertinent curiosity; and
indeed I must say that I never, in those women with whom I
conversed, observed anything on which I could put such a
construction.&nbsp; They seemed to have a faith ready for all;
and as a child when you are telling him stories, asks for
&lsquo;more, more,&rsquo; so they appeared to delight in being
amused without effort of their own minds.&nbsp; Among other
questions she asked me the old one over again, if I was married;
and when I told her that I was not, she appeared surprised, and,
as if recollecting herself, said to me, with a pious seriousness
and perfect simplicity, &lsquo;To be sure, there is a great
promise for virgins in Heaven;&rsquo; and then she began to tell
how long she had been married, that she had had a large family
and much sickness and sorrow, having lost several of her
children.&nbsp; We had clean sheets and decent beds.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>September</i> 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rose
early, and departed before breakfast.&nbsp; The morning was dry,
but cold.&nbsp; Travelled as before, along the shores of Loch
Lubnaig, and along the pass of the roaring stream of Leny, and
reached Callander at a little past eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
After breakfast set <!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>off towards Stirling, intending to
sleep there; the distance eighteen miles.&nbsp; We were now
entering upon a populous and more cultivated country, having left
the mountains behind, therefore I shall have little to tell; for
what is most interesting in such a country is not to be seen in
passing through it as we did.&nbsp; Half way between Callander
and Stirling is the village of Doune, and a little further on we
crossed a bridge over a pleasant river, the Teith.&nbsp; Above
the river stands a ruined castle of considerable size, upon a
woody bank.&nbsp; We wished to have had time to go up to the
ruin.&nbsp; Long before we reached the town of Stirling, saw the
Castle, single, on its stately and commanding eminence.&nbsp; The
rock or hill rises from a level plain; the print in
Stoddart&rsquo;s book does indeed give a good notion of its
form.&nbsp; The surrounding plain appears to be of a rich soil,
well cultivated.&nbsp; The crops of ripe corn were
abundant.&nbsp; We found the town quite full; not a vacant room
in the inn, it being the time of the assizes: there was no
lodging for us, and hardly even the possibility of getting
anything to eat in a bye-nook of the house.&nbsp; Walked up to
the Castle.&nbsp; The prospect from it is very extensive, and
must be exceedingly grand on a fine evening or morning, with the
light of the setting or rising sun on the distant mountains, but
we saw it at an unfavourable time of day, the mid-afternoon, and
were not favoured by light and shade.&nbsp; The Forth makes most
intricate and curious turnings, so that it is difficult to trace
them, even when you are overlooking the whole.&nbsp; It flows
through a perfect level, and in one place cuts its way in the
form of a large figure of eight.&nbsp; Stirling is the largest
town we had seen in Scotland, except Glasgow.&nbsp; It is an old
irregular place; the streets towards the Castle on one side very
steep.&nbsp; On the <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>other, the hill or rock rises from
the fields.&nbsp; The architecture of a part of the Castle is
very fine, and the whole building in good repair: some parts
indeed, are modern.&nbsp; At Stirling we bought Burns&rsquo;s
Poems in one volume, for two shillings.&nbsp; Went on to Falkirk,
ten or eleven miles.&nbsp; I do not recollect anything remarkable
after we were out of sight of Stirling Castle, except the Carron
Ironworks, seen at a distance;&mdash;the sky above them was red
with a fiery light.&nbsp; In passing through a turnpike gate we
were greeted by a Highland drover, who, with many others, was
coming from a fair at Falkirk, the road being covered all along
with horsemen and cattle.&nbsp; He spoke as if we had been well
known to him, asking us how we had fared on our journey.&nbsp; We
were at a loss to conceive why he should interest himself about
us, till he said he had passed us on the Black Mountain, near
King&rsquo;s House.&nbsp; It was pleasant to observe the effect
of solitary places in making men friends, and to see so much
kindness, which had been produced in such a chance encounter,
retained in a crowd.&nbsp; No beds in the inns at
Falkirk&mdash;every room taken up by the people come to the
fair.&nbsp; Lodged in a private house, a neat clean
place&mdash;kind treatment from the old man and his daughter.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>September</i>
15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Breakfasted at Linlithgow, a small town.&nbsp;
The house is yet shown from which the Regent Murray was
shot.&nbsp; The remains of a royal palace, where Queen Mary was
born, are of considerable extent; the banks of gardens and
fish-ponds may yet be distinctly traced, though the whole surface
is transformed into smooth pasturage where cattle graze.&nbsp;
The castle stands upon a gentle eminence, the prospect not
particularly pleasing, though not otherwise; it is bare and
wide.&nbsp; The shell of <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>a small
ancient church is standing, into which are crammed modern pews,
galleries, and pulpit&mdash;very ugly, and discordant with the
exterior.&nbsp; Nothing very interesting till we came to
Edinburgh.&nbsp; Dined by the way at a small town or village upon
a hill, the back part of the houses on one side overlooking an
extensive prospect over flat corn fields.&nbsp; I mention this
for the sake of a pleasant hour we passed sitting on the bank,
where we read some of Burns&rsquo;s poems in the volume which we
had bought at Stirling.</p>
<p>Arrived at Edinburgh a little before sunset.&nbsp; As we
approached, the Castle rock resembled that of Stirling&mdash;in
the same manner appearing to rise from a plain of cultivated
ground, the Firth of Forth being on the other side, and not
visible.&nbsp; Drove to the White Hart in the Grass-market, an
inn which had been mentioned to us, and which we conjectured
would better suit us than one in a more fashionable part of the
town.&nbsp; It was not noisy, and tolerably cheap.&nbsp; Drank
tea, and walked up to the Castle, which luckily was very
near.&nbsp; Much of the daylight was gone, so that except it had
been a clear evening, which it was not, we could not have seen
the distant prospect.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>September</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;The sky the
evening before, as you may remember the ostler told us, had been
&lsquo;gay and dull,&rsquo; and this morning it was downright
dismal: very dark, and promising nothing but a wet day, and
before breakfast was over the rain began, though not
heavily.&nbsp; We set out upon our walk, and went through many
streets to Holyrood House, and thence to the hill called
Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, a high hill, very rocky at the top, and
below covered with smooth turf, on which sheep were
feeding.&nbsp; We climbed up till we came to St. Anthony&rsquo;s
Well and Chapel, <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>as it is called, but it is more like
a hermitage than a chapel,&mdash;a small ruin, which from its
situation is exceedingly interesting, though in itself not
remarkable.&nbsp; We sate down on a stone not far from the
chapel, overlooking a pastoral hollow as wild and solitary as any
in the heart of the Highland mountains: there, instead of the
roaring of torrents, we listened to the noises of the city, which
were blended in one loud indistinct buzz,&mdash;a regular sound
in the air, which in certain moods of feeling, and at certain
times, might have a more tranquillizing effect upon the mind than
those which we are accustomed to hear in such places.&nbsp; The
Castle rock looked exceedingly large through the misty air: a
cloud of black smoke overhung the city, which combined with the
rain and mist to conceal the shapes of the houses,&mdash;an
obscurity which added much to the grandeur of the sound that
proceeded from it.&nbsp; It was impossible to think of anything
that was little or mean, the goings-on of trade, the strife of
men, or every-day city business:&mdash;the impression was one,
and it was visionary; like the conceptions of our childhood of
Bagdad or Balsora when we have been reading the Arabian
Nights&rsquo; Entertainments.&nbsp; Though the rain was very
heavy we remained upon the hill for some time, then returned by
the same road by which we had come, through green flat fields,
formerly the pleasure-grounds of Holyrood House, on the edge of
which stands the old roofless chapel, of venerable
architecture.&nbsp; It is a pity that it should be suffered to
fall down, for the walls appear to be yet entire.&nbsp; Very near
to the chapel is Holyrood House, which we could not but lament
has nothing ancient in its appearance, being sash-windowed and
not an irregular pile.&nbsp; It is very like a building for some
national establishment,&mdash;a hospital for soldiers or
sailors.&nbsp; You have a description <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>of it in
Stoddart&rsquo;s Tour, therefore I need not tell you what we saw
there.</p>
<p>When we found ourselves once again in the streets of the city,
we lamented over the heavy rain, and indeed before leaving the
hill, much as we were indebted to the accident of the rain for
the peculiar grandeur and affecting wildness of those objects we
saw, we could not but regret that the Firth of Forth was entirely
hidden from us, and all distant objects, and we strained our eyes
till they ached, vainly trying to pierce through the thick
mist.&nbsp; We walked industriously through the streets, street
after street, and, in spite of wet and dirt, were exceedingly
delighted.&nbsp; The old town, with its irregular houses, stage
above stage, seen as we saw it, in the obscurity of a rainy day,
hardly resembles the work of men, it is more like a piling up of
rocks, and I cannot attempt to describe what we saw so
imperfectly, but must say that, high as my expectations had been
raised, the city of Edinburgh far surpassed all
expectation.&nbsp; Gladly would we have stayed another day, but
could not afford more time, and our notions of the weather of
Scotland were so dismal, notwithstanding we ourselves had been so
much favoured, that we had no hope of its mending.&nbsp; So at
about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening we departed, intending to
sleep at an inn in the village of Roslin, about five miles from
Edinburgh.&nbsp; The rain continued till we were almost at
Roslin; but then it was quite dark, so we did not see the Castle
that night.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>September</i> 17<i>th</i>.&mdash;The
morning very fine.&nbsp; We rose early and walked through the
glen of Roslin, past Hawthornden, and considerably further, to
the house of Mr. Walter Scott at Lasswade.&nbsp; Roslin Castle
stands upon <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>a woody bank above a stream, the
North Esk, too large, I think, to be called a brook, yet an
inconsiderable river.&nbsp; We looked down upon the ruin from
higher ground.&nbsp; Near it stands the Chapel, a most elegant
building, a ruin, though the walls and roof are entire.&nbsp; I
never passed through a more delicious dell than the glen of
Roslin, though the water of the stream is dingy and muddy.&nbsp;
The banks are rocky on each side, and hung with pine wood.&nbsp;
About a mile from the Castle, on the contrary side of the water,
upon the edge of a very steep bank, stands Hawthornden, the house
of Drummond the poet, whither Ben Jonson came on foot from London
to visit his friend.&nbsp; We did hear to whom the house at
present belongs, and some other particulars, but I have a very
indistinct recollection of what was told us, except that many old
trees had been lately cut down.&nbsp; After Hawthornden the glen
widens, ceases to be rocky, and spreads out into a rich vale,
scattered over with gentlemen&rsquo;s seats.</p>
<p>Arrived at Lasswade before Mr. and Mrs. Scott had risen, and
waited some time in a large sitting-room.&nbsp; Breakfasted with
them, and stayed till two o&rsquo;clock, and Mr. Scott
accompanied us back almost to Roslin, having given us directions
respecting our future journey, and promised to meet us at Melrose
two days after. <a name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a></p>
<p>We ordered dinner on our return to the inn, and went to view
the inside of the Chapel of Roslin, which is kept locked up, and
so preserved from the injuries it might otherwise receive from
idle boys; but as nothing is done <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>to keep it
together, it must in the end fall.&nbsp; The architecture within
is exquisitely beautiful.&nbsp; The stone both of the roof and
walls is sculptured with leaves and flowers, so delicately
wrought that I could have admired them for hours, and the whole
of their groundwork is stained by time with the softest
colours.&nbsp; Some of those leaves and flowers were tinged
perfectly green, and at one part the effect was most exquisite:
three or four leaves of a small fern, resembling that which we
call adder&rsquo;s tongue, grew round a cluster of them at the
top of a pillar, and the natural product and the artificial were
so intermingled that at first it was not easy to distinguish the
living plant from the other, they being of an equally determined
green, though the fern was of a deeper shade.</p>
<p>We set forward again after dinner.&nbsp; The afternoon was
pleasant.&nbsp; Travelled through large tracts of ripe corn,
interspersed with larger tracts of moorland&mdash;the houses at a
considerable distance from each other, no longer thatched huts,
but farm-houses resembling those of the farming counties in
England, having many corn-stacks close to them.&nbsp; Dark when
we reached Peebles; found a comfortable old-fashioned
public-house, had a neat parlour, and drank tea.</p>
<h2><!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>SIXTH WEEK.</h2>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, <i>September</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;The town of
Peebles is on the banks of the Tweed.&nbsp; After breakfast
walked up the river to Neidpath Castle, about a mile and a half
from the town.&nbsp; The castle stands upon a green hill,
overlooking the Tweed, a strong square-towered edifice, neglected
and desolate, though not in ruin, the garden overgrown with
grass, and the high walls that fenced it broken down.&nbsp; The
Tweed winds between green steeps, upon which, and close to the
river side, large flocks of sheep pasturing; higher still are the
grey mountains; but I need not describe the scene, for William
has done it better than I could do in a sonnet which he wrote the
same day; the five last lines, at least, of his poem will impart
to you more of the feeling of the place than it would be possible
for me to do:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Degenerate Douglass! thou unworthy Lord<br />
Whom mere despite of heart could so far please,<br />
And love of havoc (for with such disease<br />
Fame taxes him) that he could send forth word<br />
To level with the dust a noble horde,<br />
A brotherhood of venerable trees,<br />
Leaving an ancient Dome and Towers like these<br />
Beggar&rsquo;d and outraged!&nbsp; Many hearts deplored<br />
The fate of those old trees; and oft with pain<br />
The Traveller at this day will stop and gaze<br />
<!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>On wrongs which Nature scarcely seems to heed;<br />
For shelter&rsquo;d places, bosoms, nooks, and bays,<br />
And the pure mountains, and the gentle Tweed,<br />
And the green silent pastures yet remain.</p>
<p><i>I</i> was spared any regret for the fallen woods when we
were there, not then knowing the history of them.&nbsp; The soft
low mountains, the castle, and the decayed pleasure-grounds, the
scattered trees which have been left in different parts, and the
road carried in a very beautiful line along the side of the hill,
with the Tweed murmuring through the unfenced green pastures
spotted with sheep, together composed an harmonious scene, and I
wished for nothing that was not there.&nbsp; When we were with
Mr. Scott he spoke of cheerful days he had spent in that castle
not many years ago, when it was inhabited by Professor Ferguson
and his family, whom the Duke of Queensberry, its churlish owner,
forced to quit it.&nbsp; We discovered a very fine echo within a
few yards of the building.</p>
<p>The town of Peebles looks very pretty from the road in
returning: it is an old town, built of grey stone, the same as
the castle.&nbsp; Well-dressed people were going to church.&nbsp;
Sent the car before, and walked ourselves, and while going along
the main street William was called aside in a mysterious manner
by a person who gravely examined him&mdash;whether he was an
Irishman or a foreigner, or what he was; I suppose our car was
the occasion of suspicion at a time when every one was talking of
the threatened invasion.&nbsp; We had a day&rsquo;s journey
before us along the banks of the Tweed, a name which has been
sweet to my ears almost as far back as I can remember
anything.&nbsp; After the first mile or two our road was seldom
far from the <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>river, which flowed in gentleness,
though perhaps never silent; the hills on either side high and
sometimes stony, but excellent pasturage for sheep.&nbsp; In some
parts the vale was wholly of this pastoral character, in others
we saw extensive tracts of corn ground, even spreading along
whole hill-sides, and without visible fences, which is dreary in
a flat country; but there is no dreariness on the banks of the
Tweed,&mdash;the hills, whether smooth or stony, uncultivated or
covered with ripe corn, had the same pensive softness.&nbsp; Near
the corn tracts were large farm-houses, with many corn-stacks;
the stacks and house and out-houses together, I recollect, in one
or two places upon the hills, at a little distance, seemed almost
as large as a small village or hamlet.&nbsp; It was a clear
autumnal day, without wind, and, being Sunday, the business of
the harvest was suspended, and all that we saw, and felt, and
heard, combined to excite one sensation of pensive and still
pleasure.</p>
<p>Passed by several old halls yet inhabited, and others in ruin;
but I have hardly a sufficiently distinct recollection of any of
them to be able to describe them, and I now at this distance of
time regret that I did not take notes.&nbsp; In one very sweet
part of the vale a gate crossed the road, which was opened by an
old woman who lived in a cottage close to it; I said to her,
&lsquo;You live in a very pretty place!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;the water of Tweed is a
bonny water.&rsquo;&nbsp; The lines of the hills are flowing and
beautiful, the reaches of the vale long; in some places appear
the remains of a forest, in others you will see as lovely a
combination of forms as any traveller who goes in search of the
picturesque need desire, and yet perhaps without a single tree;
or at least if trees there are, they shall be very few, and he
shall not care whether they are there or not.</p>
<p><!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>The road took us through one long village, but I do not
recollect any other; yet I think we never had a mile&rsquo;s
length before us without a house, though seldom several cottages
together.&nbsp; The loneliness of the scattered dwellings, the
more stately edifices decaying or in ruin, or, if inhabited, not
in their pride and freshness, aided the general effect of the
gently varying scenes, which was that of tender pensiveness; no
bursting torrents when we were there, but the murmuring of the
river was heard distinctly, often blended with the bleating of
sheep.&nbsp; In one place we saw a shepherd lying in the midst of
a flock upon a sunny knoll, with his face towards the
sky,&mdash;happy picture of shepherd life.</p>
<p>The transitions of this vale were all gentle except one, a
scene of which a gentleman&rsquo;s house was the centre, standing
low in the vale, the hills above it covered with gloomy fir
plantations, and the appearance of the house itself, though it
could scarcely be seen, was gloomy.&nbsp; There was an
allegorical air&mdash;a person fond of Spenser will understand
me&mdash;in this uncheerful spot, single in such a country,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The house was hearsed about with a black
wood.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have since heard that it was the residence of Lord
Traquair, a Roman Catholic nobleman, of a decayed family.</p>
<p>We left the Tweed when we were within about a mile and a half
or two miles of Clovenford, where we were to lodge.&nbsp; Turned
up the side of a hill, and went along sheep-grounds till we
reached the spot&mdash;a single stone house, without a tree near
it or to be seen from it.&nbsp; On our mentioning Mr.
Scott&rsquo;s name the woman of the house showed us all possible
civility, but her slowness was really <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>amusing.&nbsp; I should suppose it is a house little
frequented, for there is no appearance of an inn.&nbsp; Mr.
Scott, who she told me was a very clever gentleman, &lsquo;goes
there in the fishing season;&rsquo; but indeed Mr. Scott is
respected everywhere: I believe that by favour of his name one
might be hospitably entertained throughout all the borders of
Scotland.&nbsp; We dined and drank tea&mdash;did not walk out,
for there was no temptation; a confined barren prospect from the
window.</p>
<p>At Clovenford, being so near to the Yarrow, we could not but
think of the possibility of going thither, but came to the
conclusion of reserving the pleasure for some future time, in
consequence of which, after our return, William wrote the poem
which I shall here transcribe:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">From Stirling Castle we had seen<br />
The mazy Forth unravell&rsquo;d,<br />
Had trod the banks of Clyde and Tay,<br />
And with the Tweed had travell&rsquo;d.<br />
And when we came to Clovenford,<br />
Then said my winsome Marrow,<br />
&lsquo;Whate&rsquo;er betide we&rsquo;ll turn aside<br />
And see the Braes of Yarrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Let Yarrow Folk frae Selkirk Town,<br />
Who have been buying, selling,<br />
Go back to Yarrow:&mdash;&rsquo;tis their own,<br />
Each Maiden to her dwelling.<br />
On Yarrow&rsquo;s banks let herons feed,<br />
Hares couch, and rabbits burrow,<br />
But we will downwards with the Tweed,<br />
Nor turn aside to Yarrow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span

Made blithe with plough and harrow,<br />
Why throw away a needful day,<br />
To go in search of Yarrow?</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s Yarrow but a river bare,<br
/>
That glides the dark hills under?<br />
There are a thousand such elsewhere,<br />
As worthy of your wonder.&rsquo;<br />
Strange words they seem&rsquo;d of slight and scorn,<br />
My true-love sigh&rsquo;d for sorrow,<br />
And look&rsquo;d me in the face to think<br />
I thus could speak of Yarrow.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Oh! green,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;are
Yarrow&rsquo;s Holms,<br />
And sweet is Yarrow flowing,<br />
Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,<br />
But we will leave it growing.<br />
O&rsquo;er hilly path and open Strath<br />
We&rsquo;ll wander Scotland thorough,<br />
But though so near we will not turn<br />
Into the Dale of Yarrow.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Let beeves and home-bred kine partake<br
/>
The sweets of Burnmill Meadow,<br />
The swan on still St. Mary&rsquo;s Lake<br />
Float double, swan and shadow.<br />
We will not see them, will not go,<br />
To-day nor yet to-morrow;<br />
Enough if in our hearts we know<br />
There&rsquo;s such a place as Yarrow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span

unknown,<br />
It must, or we shall rue it,<br />
We have a vision of our own,<br />
Ah! why should we undo it?<br />
The treasured dreams of times long past,<br />
We&rsquo;ll keep them, &ldquo;winsome Marrow,&rdquo;<br />
For when we&rsquo;re there, although &rsquo;tis fair,<br />
&rsquo;Twill be another Yarrow.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;If care with freezing years should
come,<br />
And wandering seem but folly,<br />
Should we be loth to stir from home,<br />
And yet be melancholy,<br />
Should life be dull and spirits low,<br />
&rsquo;Twill soothe us in our sorrow<br />
That earth has something yet to show&mdash;<br />
The bonny Holms of Yarrow.&rsquo; <a name="citation254"></a><a

<p>The next day we were to meet Mr. Scott, and again join the
Tweed.&nbsp; I wish I could have given you a better idea of what
we saw between Peebles and this place.&nbsp; I have most distinct
recollections of the effect of the whole day&rsquo;s journey; but
the objects are mostly melted together in my memory, and though I
should recognise them if we revisit the place, I cannot call them
out so as to represent them to you with distinctness.&nbsp;
William, in attempting in verse to describe this part of the
Tweed, says of it,</p>
<p class="poetry">More pensive in sunshine<br />
Than others in moonshine.</p>
<p>which perhaps may give you more power to conceive what it is
than all I have said.</p>

255</span><i>Monday</i>, <i>September</i> 19<i>th</i>.&mdash;We
rose early, and went to Melrose, six miles, before
breakfast.&nbsp; After ascending a hill, descended, and
overlooked a dell, on the opposite side of which was an old
mansion, surrounded with trees and steep gardens, a curious and
pleasing, yet melancholy spot; for the house and gardens were
evidently going to decay, and the whole of the small dell, except
near the house, was unenclosed and uncultivated, being a
sheep-walk to the top of the hills.&nbsp; Descended to Gala
Water, a pretty stream, but much smaller than the Tweed, into
which the brook flows from the glen I have spoken of.&nbsp; Near
the Gala is a large modern house, the situation very pleasant,
but the old building which we had passed put to shame the fresh
colouring and meagre outline of the new one.&nbsp; Went through a
part of the village of Galashiels, pleasantly situated on the
bank of the stream; a pretty place it once has been, but a
manufactory is established there; and a townish bustle and ugly
stone houses are fast taking place of the brown-roofed thatched
cottages, of which a great number yet remain, partly overshadowed
by trees.&nbsp; Left the Gala, and, after crossing the open
country, came again to the Tweed, and pursued our way as before
near the river, perhaps for a mile or two, till we arrived at
Melrose.&nbsp; The valley for this short space was not so
pleasing as before, the hills more broken, and though the
cultivation was general, yet the scene was not rich, while it had
lost its pastoral simplicity.&nbsp; At Melrose the vale opens out
wide; but the hills are high all round&mdash;single distinct
risings.&nbsp; After breakfast we went out, intending to go to
the Abbey, and in the street met Mr. Scott, who gave us a cordial
greeting, and conducted us thither himself.&nbsp; He was here on
his own ground, for he is familiar with all that is <!-- page
256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>known of the authentic history of Melrose and the
popular tales connected with it.&nbsp; He pointed out many pieces
of beautiful sculpture in obscure corners which would have
escaped our notice.&nbsp; The Abbey has been built of a pale red
stone; that part which was first erected of a very durable kind,
the sculptured flowers and leaves and other minute ornaments
being as perfect in many places as when first wrought.&nbsp; The
ruin is of considerable extent, but unfortunately it is almost
surrounded by insignificant houses, so that when you are close to
it you see it entirely separated from many rural objects, and
even when viewed from a distance the situation does not seem to
be particularly happy, for the vale is broken and disturbed, and
the Abbey at a distance from the river, so that you do not look
upon them as companions of each other.&nbsp; And surely this is a
national barbarism: within these beautiful walls is the ugliest
church that was ever beheld&mdash;if it had been hewn out of the
side of a hill it could not have been more dismal; there was no
neatness, nor even decency, and it appeared to be so damp, and so
completely excluded from fresh air, that it must be dangerous to
sit in it; the floor is unpaved, and very rough.&nbsp; What a
contrast to the beautiful and graceful order apparent in every
part of the ancient design and workmanship!&nbsp; Mr. Scott went
with us into the gardens and orchards of a Mr. Riddel, from which
we had a very sweet view of the Abbey through trees, the town
being entirely excluded.&nbsp; Dined with Mr. Scott at the inn;
he was now travelling to the assizes at Jedburgh in his character
of Sheriff of Selkirk, and on that account, as well as for his
own sake, he was treated with great respect, a small part of
which was vouchsafed to us as his friends, though I could not
persuade the woman to show me the <!-- page 257--><a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>beds, or to
make any sort of promise till she was assured from the Sheriff
himself that he had no objection to sleep in the same room with
William.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>, <i>September</i> 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Mr. Scott
departed very early for Jedburgh, and we soon followed, intending
to go by Dryburgh to Kelso.&nbsp; It was a fine morning.&nbsp; We
went without breakfast, being told that there was a public-house
at Dryburgh.&nbsp; The road was very pleasant, seldom out of
sight of the Tweed for any length of time, though not often close
to it.&nbsp; The valley is not so pleasantly defined as between
Peebles and Clovenford, yet so soft and beautiful, and in many
parts pastoral, but that peculiar and pensive simplicity which I
have spoken of before was wanting, yet there was a fertility
chequered with wildness which to many travellers would be more
than a compensation.&nbsp; The reaches of the vale were shorter,
the turnings more rapid, the banks often clothed with wood.&nbsp;
In one place was a lofty scar, at another a green promontory, a
small hill skirted by the river, the hill above irregular and
green, and scattered over with trees.&nbsp; We wished we could
have brought the ruins of Melrose to that spot, and mentioned
this to Mr. Scott, who told us that the monks had first fixed
their abode there, and raised a temporary building of wood.&nbsp;
The monastery of Melrose was founded by a colony from Rievaux
Abbey in Yorkshire, which building it happens to resemble in the
colour of the stone, and I think partly in the style of
architecture, but is much smaller, that is, has been much
smaller, for there is not at Rievaux any one single part of the
ruin so large as the remains of the church at Melrose, though at
Rievaux a far more extensive ruin remains.&nbsp; It is also much
grander, <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>and the situation at present much
more beautiful, that ruin not having suffered like Melrose Abbey
from the encroachments of a town.&nbsp; The architecture at
Melrose is, I believe, superior in the exactness and taste of
some of the minute ornamental parts; indeed, it is impossible to
conceive anything more delicate than the workmanship, especially
in the imitations of flowers.</p>
<p>We descended to Dryburgh after having gone a considerable way
upon high ground.&nbsp; A heavy rain when we reached the village,
and there was no public-house.&nbsp; A well-dressed, well-spoken
woman courteously&mdash;shall I say charitably?&mdash;invited us
into her cottage, and permitted us to make breakfast; she showed
us into a neat parlour, furnished with prints, a mahogany table,
and other things which I was surprised to see, for her husband
was only a day-labourer, but she had been Lady Buchan&rsquo;s
waiting-maid, which accounted for these luxuries and for a
noticeable urbanity in her manners.&nbsp; All the cottages in
this neighbourhood, if I am not mistaken, were covered with red
tiles, and had chimneys.&nbsp; After breakfast we set out in the
rain to the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey, which are near Lord
Buchan&rsquo;s house, and, like Bothwell Castle, appropriated to
the pleasure of the owner.&nbsp; We rang a bell at the gate, and,
instead of a porter, an old woman came to open it through a
narrow side-alley cut in a thick plantation of evergreens.&nbsp;
On entering, saw the thatch of her hut just above the trees, and
it looked very pretty, but the poor creature herself was a figure
to frighten a child,&mdash;bowed almost double, having a hooked
nose and overhanging eyebrows, a complexion stained brown with
smoke, and a cap that might have been worn for months and never
washed.&nbsp; No doubt she had been cowering over <!-- page
259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>her peat fire, for if she had emitted smoke by her
breath and through every pore, the odour could not have been
stronger.&nbsp; This ancient woman, by right of office, attended
us to show off the curiosities, and she had her tale as perfect,
though it was not quite so long a one, as the gentleman Swiss,
whom I remember to have seen at Blenheim with his slender wand
and dainty white clothes.&nbsp; The house of Lord Buchan and the
Abbey stand upon a large flat peninsula, a green holm almost
covered with fruit-trees.&nbsp; The ruins of Dryburgh are much
less extensive than those of Melrose, and greatly inferior both
in the architecture and stone, which is much mouldered
away.&nbsp; Lord Buchan has trained pear-trees along the walls,
which are bordered with flowers and gravel walks, and he has made
a pigeon-house, and a fine room in the ruin, ornamented with a
curiously-assorted collection of busts of eminent men, in which
lately a ball was given; yet, deducting for all these
improvements, which are certainly much less offensive than you
could imagine, it is a very sweet ruin, standing so enclosed in
wood, which the towers overtop, that you cannot know that it is
not in a state of natural desolation till you are close to
it.&nbsp; The opposite bank of the Tweed is steep and woody, but
unfortunately many of the trees are firs.&nbsp; The old woman
followed us after the fashion of other guides, but being slower
of foot than a younger person, it was not difficult to slip away
from the scent of her poor smoke-dried body.&nbsp; She was
sedulous in pointing out the curiosities, which, I doubt not, she
had a firm belief were not to be surpassed in England or
Scotland.</p>
<p>Having promised us a sight of the largest and oldest yew-tree
ever seen, she conducted us to it; it was a goodly <!-- page
260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>tree, but a mere dwarf compared with several of our own
country&mdash;not to speak of the giant of Lorton.&nbsp; We
returned to the cottage, and waited some time in hopes that the
rain would abate, but it grew worse and worse, and we were
obliged to give up our journey, to Kelso, taking the direct road
to Jedburgh.</p>
<p>We had to ford the Tweed, a wide river at the
crossing-place.&nbsp; It would have been impossible to drive the
horse through, for he had not forgotten the fright at Connel
Ferry, so we hired a man to lead us.&nbsp; After crossing the
water, the road goes up the bank, and we had a beautiful view of
the ruins of the Abbey, peering above the trees of the woody
peninsula, which, in shape, resembles that formed by the Tees at
Lickburn, but is considerably smaller.&nbsp; Lord Buchan&rsquo;s
house is a very neat, modest building, and almost hidden by
trees.&nbsp; It soon began to rain heavily.&nbsp; Crossing the
Teviot by a stone bridge&mdash;the vale in that part very
wide&mdash;there was a great deal of ripe corn, but a want of
trees, and no appearance of richness.&nbsp; Arrived at Jedburgh
half an hour before the Judges were expected out of Court to
dinner.</p>
<p>We gave in our passport&mdash;the name of Mr. Scott, the
Sheriff&mdash;and were very civilly treated, but there was no
vacant room in the house except the Judge&rsquo;s sitting-room,
and we wanted to have a fire, being exceedingly wet and
cold.&nbsp; I was conducted into that room, on condition that I
would give it up the moment the Judge came from Court.&nbsp;
After I had put off my wet clothes I went up into a bedroom, and
sate shivering there, till the people of the inn had procured
lodgings for us in a private house.</p>
<p>We were received with hearty welcome by a good woman, who,
though above seventy years old, moved about as <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>briskly as
if she was only seventeen.&nbsp; Those parts of the house which
we were to occupy were neat and clean; she showed me every
corner, and, before I had been ten minutes in the house, opened
her very drawers that I might see what a stock of linen she had;
then asked me how long we should stay, and said she wished we
were come for three months.&nbsp; She was a most remarkable
person; the alacrity with which she ran up-stairs when we rung
the bell, and guessed at, and strove to prevent, our wants was
surprising; she had a quick eye, and keen strong features, and a
joyousness in her motions, like what used to be in old Molly when
she was particularly elated.&nbsp; I found afterwards that she
had been subject to fits of dejection and ill-health: we then
conjectured that her overflowing gaiety and strength might in
part be attributed to the same cause as her former
dejection.&nbsp; Her husband was deaf and infirm, and sate in a
chair with scarcely the power to move a limb&mdash;an affecting
contrast!&nbsp; The old woman said they had been a very
hard-working pair; they had wrought like slaves at their
trade&mdash;her husband had been a currier; and she told me how
they had portioned off their daughters with money, and each a
feather-bed, and that in their old age they had laid out the
little they could spare in building and furnishing that house,
and she added with pride that she had lived in her youth in the
family of Lady Egerton, who was no high lady, and now was in the
habit of coming to her house whenever she was at Jedburgh, and a
hundred other things; for when she once began with Lady Egerton,
she did not know how to stop, nor did I wish it, for she was very
entertaining.&nbsp; Mr. Scott sate with us an hour or two, and
repeated a part of the Lay of the Last Minstrel.&nbsp; When he
was gone our hostess came to see if we wanted <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>anything,
and to wish us good-night.&nbsp; On all occasions her manners
were governed by the same spirit: there was no withdrawing
one&rsquo;s attention from her.&nbsp; We were so much interested
that William, long afterwards, thought it worth while to express
in verse the sensations which she had excited, and which then
remained as vividly in his mind as at the moment when we lost
sight of Jedburgh:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Age! twine thy brows with fresh spring
flowers,<br />
And call a train of laughing Hours;<br />
And bid them dance, and bid them sing,<br />
And Thou, too, mingle in the Ring!<br />
Take to thy heart a new delight!<br />
If not, make merry in despite<br />
That one should breathe who scorns thy power.<br />
&mdash;But dance! for under Jedborough Tower<br />
A Matron dwells who, tho&rsquo; she bears<br />
Our mortal complement of years,<br />
Lives in the light of youthful glee,<br />
And she will dance and sing with thee.</p>
<p class="poetry">Nay! start not at that Figure&mdash;there!<br

And useless arms, a Trunk of Man,<br />
He sits, and with a vacant eye;<br />
A Sight to make a Stranger sigh!<br />
Deaf, drooping, such is now his doom;<br />
His world is in that single room&mdash;<br />
Is this a place for mirthful cheer?<br />
Can merry-making enter here?</p>

Not long this mystery did detain<br />
My thoughts.&nbsp; She told in pensive strain<br />
That she had borne a heavy yoke,<br />
Been stricken by a twofold stroke;<br />
Ill health of body, and had pined<br />
Beneath worse ailments of the mind.</p>

265</span><i>Wednesday</i>, <i>September</i>
21<i>st</i>.&mdash;The house where we lodged was airy, and even
cheerful, though one of a line of houses bordering on the
churchyard, which is the highest part of the town, overlooking a
great portion of it to the opposite hills.&nbsp; The kirk is, as
at Melrose, within the walls of a conventual church; but the ruin
is much less beautiful, and the church a very neat one.&nbsp; The
churchyard was full of graves, and exceedingly slovenly and
dirty; one most indecent practice I observed: several women
brought their linen to the flat table-tombstones, and, having
spread it upon them, began to batter as hard as they could with a
wooden roller, a substitute for a mangle.</p>
<p>After Mr. Scott&rsquo;s business in the Courts was over, he
walked with us up the Jed&mdash;&lsquo;sylvan Jed&rsquo; it has
been properly called by Thomson&mdash;for the banks are yet very
woody, though wood in large quantities has been felled within a
few years.&nbsp; There are some fine red scars near the river, in
one or two of which we saw the entrances to caves, said to have
been used as places of refuge in times of insecurity.</p>
<p>Walked up to Ferniehurst, an old hall, in a secluded
situation, now inhabited by farmers; the neighbouring ground had
the wildness of a forest, being irregularly scattered over with
fine old trees.&nbsp; The wind was tossing their branches, and
sunshine dancing among the leaves, and I happened to exclaim,
&lsquo;What a life there is in trees!&rsquo; on which Mr. Scott
observed that the words reminded him of a young lady who had been
born and educated on an island of the Orcades, and came to spend
a summer at Kelso and in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.&nbsp;
She used to say that in the new world into which she was come
nothing had disappointed her so much as trees and woods; she
complained that they were lifeless, silent, and, compared <!--
page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>with the grandeur of the ever-changing ocean, even
insipid.&nbsp; At first I was surprised, but the next moment I
felt that the impression was natural.&nbsp; Mr. Scott said that
she was a very sensible young woman, and had read much.&nbsp; She
talked with endless rapture and feeling of the power and
greatness of the ocean; and with the same passionate attachment
returned to her native island without any probability of quitting
it again.</p>
<p>The valley of the Jed is very solitary immediately under
Ferniehurst; we walked down the river, wading almost up to the
knees in fern, which in many parts overspread the
forest-ground.&nbsp; It made me think of our walks at Allfoxden,
and of <i>our own</i> park&mdash;though at Ferniehurst is no park
at present&mdash;and the slim fawns that we used to startle from
their couching-places among the fern at the top of the
hill.&nbsp; We were accompanied on our walk by a young man from
the Braes of Yarrow, an acquaintance of Mr. Scott&rsquo;s, <a
name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266"
class="citation">[266]</a> who, having been much delighted with
some of William&rsquo;s poems which he had chanced to see in a
newspaper, had wished to be introduced to him; he lived in the
most retired part of the dale of Yarrow, where he had a farm: he
was fond of reading, and well informed, but at first meeting as
shy as any of our Grasmere lads, and not less rustic in his
appearance.&nbsp; He had been in the Highlands, and gave me such
an account of Loch Rannoch as made us regret that we had not
persevered in our journey thither, especially as he told us that
the bad road ended at a very little distance from the place where
we had turned back, and that we should have come into another
good road, continued all along the shore of the lake.&nbsp; He
also mentioned that there was a very fine view from the steeple
at Dunkeld.</p>
<p><!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>The town of Jedburgh, in returning along the road, as
it is seen through the gently winding narrow valley, looks
exceedingly beautiful on its low eminence, surmounted by the
conventual tower, which is arched over, at the summit, by light
stone-work resembling a coronet; the effect at a distance is very
graceful.&nbsp; The hills all round are high, and rise rapidly
from the town, which though it stands considerably above the
river, yet, from every side except that on which we walked,
appears to stand in a bottom.</p>
<p>We had our dinner sent from the inn, and a bottle of wine,
that we might not disgrace the Sheriff, who supped with us in the
evening,&mdash;stayed late, and repeated some of his poem.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Thursday</i>, <i>September</i> 22<i>d</i>.&mdash;After
breakfast, the minister, Dr. Somerville, called upon us with Mr.
Scott, and we went to the manse, a very pretty house, with pretty
gardens, and in a beautiful situation, though close to the
town.&nbsp; Dr. Somerville and his family complained bitterly of
the devastation that had been made among the woods within view
from their windows, which looked up the Jed.&nbsp; He conducted
us to the church, which under his directions has been lately
repaired, and is a very neat place within.&nbsp; Dr. Somerville
spoke of the dirt and other indecencies in the churchyard, and
said that he had taken great pains to put a stop to them, but
wholly in vain.&nbsp; The business of the assizes closed this
day, and we went into Court to hear the Judge pronounce his
charge, which was the most curious specimen of old woman&rsquo;s
oratory and newspaper-paragraph loyalty that was ever
heard.&nbsp; When all was over they returned to the inn in
procession, as they had come, to the sound of a trumpet, the
Judge first, in his robes of red, <!-- page 268--><a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the
Sheriffs next, in large cocked hats, and inferior officers
following, a show not much calculated to awe the beholders.&nbsp;
After this we went to the inn.&nbsp; The landlady and her sister
inquired if we had been comfortable, and lamented that they had
not had it in their power to pay us more attention.&nbsp; I began
to talk with them, and found out that they were from Cumberland:
they knew Captain and Mrs. Wordsworth, who had frequently been at
Jedburgh, Mrs. Wordsworth&rsquo;s sister having married a
gentleman of that neighbourhood.&nbsp; They spoke of them with
great pleasure.&nbsp; I returned to our lodgings to take leave of
the old woman, who told me that I had behaved &lsquo;very
discreetly,&rsquo; and seemed exceedingly sorry that we were
leaving her so soon.&nbsp; She had been out to buy me some pears,
saying that I must take away some &lsquo;Jedderd&rsquo;
pears.&nbsp; We learned afterwards that Jedburgh is famous in
Scotland for pears, which were first cultivated there in the
gardens of the monks.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott was very glad to part from the Judge and his
retinue, to travel with us in our car to Hawick; his servant
drove his own gig.&nbsp; The landlady, very kindly, had put up
some sandwiches and cheese-cakes for me, and all the family came
out to see us depart.&nbsp; Passed the monastery gardens, which
are yet gardens, where there are many remarkably large old
pear-trees.&nbsp; We soon came into the vale of Teviot, which is
open and cultivated, and scattered over with hamlets, villages,
and many gentlemen&rsquo;s seats, yet, though there is no
inconsiderable quantity of wood, you can never, in the wide and
cultivated parts of the Teviot, get rid of the impression of
barrenness, and the fir plantations, which in this part are
numerous, are for ever at war with simplicity.&nbsp; One
beautiful spot I <!-- page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>recollect of a different character,
which Mr. Scott took us to see a few yards from the road.&nbsp; A
stone bridge crossed the water at a deep and still place, called
Horne&rsquo;s Pool, from a contemplative schoolmaster, who had
lived not far from it, and was accustomed to walk thither, and
spend much of his leisure near the river.&nbsp; The valley was
here narrow and woody.&nbsp; Mr. Scott pointed out to us
Ruberslaw, Minto Crags, and every other remarkable object in or
near the vale of Teviot, and we scarcely passed a house for which
he had not some story.&nbsp; Seeing us look at one, which stood
high on the hill on the opposite side of the river, he told us
that a gentleman lived there who, while he was in India, had been
struck with the fancy of making his fortune by a new speculation,
and so set about collecting the gods of the country, with
infinite pains and no little expense, expecting that he might
sell them for an enormous price.&nbsp; Accordingly, on his return
they were offered for sale, but no purchasers came.&nbsp; On the
failure of this scheme, a room was hired in London in which to
exhibit them as a show; but alas! nobody would come to see; and
this curious assemblage of monsters is now, probably, quietly
lodged in the vale of Teviot.&nbsp; The latter part of this
gentleman&rsquo;s history is more affecting:&mdash;he had an only
daughter, whom he had accompanied into Spain two or three years
ago for the recovery of her health, and so for a time saved her
from a consumption, which now again threatened her, and he was
about to leave his pleasant residence, and attend her once more
on the same errand, afraid of the coming winter.</p>
<p>We passed through a village, whither Leyden, Scott&rsquo;s
intimate friend, the author of Scenes of Infancy, was used to
walk over several miles of moorland country every day <!-- page
270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>to
school, a poor barefooted boy.&nbsp; He is now in India, applying
himself to the study of Oriental literature, and, I doubt not, it
is his dearest thought that he may come and end his days upon the
banks of Teviot, or some other of the Lowland streams&mdash;for
he is, like Mr. Scott, passionately attached to the district of
the Borders.</p>
<p>Arrived at Hawick to dinner; the inn is a large old house with
walls above a yard thick, formerly a gentleman&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; Did not go out this evening.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Friday</i>, <i>September</i> 23<i>d</i>.&mdash;Before
breakfast, walked with Mr. Scott along a high road for about two
miles, up a bare hill.&nbsp; Hawick is a small town.&nbsp; From
the top of the hill we had an extensive view over the moors of
Liddisdale, and saw the Cheviot Hills.&nbsp; We wished we could
have gone with Mr. Scott into some of the remote dales of this
country, where in almost every house he can find a home and a
hearty welcome.&nbsp; But after breakfast we were obliged to part
with him, which we did with great regret: he would gladly have
gone with us to Langholm, eighteen miles further.&nbsp; Our way
was through the vale of Teviot, near the banks of the river.</p>
<p>Passed Branxholm Hall, one of the mansions belonging to the
Duke of Buccleuch, which we looked at with particular interest
for the sake of the Lay of the Last Minstrel.&nbsp; Only a very
small part of the original building remains: it is a large strong
house, old, but not ancient in its appearance&mdash;stands very
near the river-side; the banks covered with plantations.</p>
<p>A little further on, met the Edinburgh coach with several
passengers, the only stage-coach that had passed us in
Scotland.&nbsp; Coleridge had come home by that <!-- page
271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>conveyance only a few days before.&nbsp; The quantity
of arable land gradually diminishes, and the plantations become
fewer, till at last the river flows open to the sun, mostly
through unfenced and untilled grounds, a soft pastoral district,
both the hills and the valley being scattered over with sheep:
here and there was a single farm-house, or cluster of houses, and
near them a portion of land covered with ripe corn.</p>
<p>Near the head of the vale of Teviot, where that stream is but
a small rivulet, we descended towards another valley, by another
small rivulet.&nbsp; Hereabouts Mr. Scott had directed us to look
about for some old stumps of trees, said to be the place where
Johnny Armstrong was hanged; but we could not find them
out.&nbsp; The valley into which we were descending, though, for
aught I know, it is unnamed in song, was to us more interesting
than the Teviot itself.&nbsp; Not a spot of tilled ground was
there to break in upon its pastoral simplicity; the same soft
yellow green spread from the bed of the streamlet to the
hill-tops on each side, and sheep were feeding everywhere.&nbsp;
It was more close and simple than the upper end of the vale of
Teviot, the valley being much narrower, and the hills equally
high and not broken into parts, but on each side a long
range.&nbsp; The grass, as we had first seen near Crawfordjohn,
had been mown in the different places of the open ground, where
it might chance to be best; but there was no part of the surface
that looked perfectly barren, as in those tracts.</p>
<p>We saw a single stone house a long way before us, which we
conjectured to be, as it proved, Moss Paul, the inn where we were
to bait.&nbsp; The scene, with this single dwelling, was
melancholy and wild, but not dreary, though there was no tree nor
shrub; the small streamlet glittered, the hills were populous
with sheep; but the gentle <!-- page 272--><a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>bending of
the valley, and the correspondent softness in the forms of the
hills, were of themselves enough to delight the eye.&nbsp; At
Moss Paul we fed our horse;&mdash;several travellers were
drinking whisky.&nbsp; We neither ate nor drank, for we had, with
our usual foresight and frugality in travelling, saved the
cheese-cakes and sandwiches which had been given us by our
countrywoman at Jedburgh the day before.&nbsp; After Moss Paul,
we ascended considerably, then went down other reaches of the
valley, much less interesting, stony and barren.&nbsp; The
country afterwards not peculiar, I should think, for I scarcely
remember it.</p>
<p>Arrived at Langholm at about five o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The
town, as we approached, from a hill, looked very pretty, the
houses being roofed with blue slates, and standing close to the
river Esk, here a large river, that scattered its waters wide
over a stony channel.&nbsp; The inn neat and
comfortable&mdash;exceedingly clean: I could hardly believe we
were still in Scotland.</p>
<p>After tea walked out; crossed a bridge, and saw, at a little
distance up the valley, Langholm House, a villa of the Duke of
Buccleuch: it stands upon a level between the river and a steep
hill, which is planted with wood.&nbsp; Walked a considerable way
up the river, but could not go close to it on account of the
Duke&rsquo;s plantations, which are locked up.&nbsp; When they
ended, the vale became less cultivated; the view through the vale
towards the hills very pleasing, though bare and cold.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Saturday</i>, <i>September</i> 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rose very
early and travelled about nine miles to Longtown, before
breakfast, along the banks of the Esk.&nbsp; About half a mile
from Langholm crossed a bridge.&nbsp; At this part of the vale,
which is narrow, <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>the steeps are covered with old oaks
and every variety of trees.&nbsp; Our road for some time through
the wood, then came to a more open country, exceedingly rich and
populous; the banks of the river frequently rocky, and hung with
wood; many gentlemen&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; There was the same
rich variety while the river continued to flow through Scottish
grounds; but not long after we had passed through the last
turnpike gate in Scotland and the first in England&mdash;but a
few yards asunder&mdash;the vale widens, and its aspect was cold,
and even dreary, though Sir James Graham&rsquo;s plantations are
very extensive.&nbsp; His house, a large building, stands in this
open part of the vale.&nbsp; Longtown was before us, and ere long
we saw the well-remembered guide-post, where the circuit of our
six weeks&rsquo; travels had begun, and now was ended.</p>
<p>We did not look along the white line of the road to Solway
Moss without some melancholy emotion, though we had the fair
prospect of the Cumberland mountains full in view, with the
certainty, barring accidents, of reaching our own dear home the
next day.&nbsp; Breakfasted at the Graham&rsquo;s Arms.&nbsp; The
weather had been very fine from the time of our arrival at
Jedburgh, and this was a very pleasant day.&nbsp; The sun
&lsquo;shone fair on Carlisle walls&rsquo; when we first saw them
from the top of the opposite hill.&nbsp; Stopped to look at the
place on the sand near the bridge where Hatfield had been
executed.&nbsp; Put up at the same inn as before, and were
recognised by the woman who had waited on us.&nbsp; Everybody
spoke of Hatfield as an injured man.&nbsp; After dinner went to a
village six miles further, where we slept.</p>

public-house by the road-side; dined at Threlkeld; arrived at
home between eight and nine o&rsquo;clock, where we found Mary in
perfect health, Joanna Hutchinson with her, and little John
asleep in the clothes-basket by the fire.</p>

<h3>TO THE SONS OF BURNS,<br />
after visiting the grave of their father.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Poet&rsquo;s grave is in a corner of
the churchyard.&nbsp; We looked at it with melancholy and painful
reflections, repeating to each other his own verses&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a man whose judgment clear,&rdquo;
etc.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Extract from the Journal of my
Fellow-Traveller</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Mid crowded obelisks and urns<br />
I sought the untimely grave of Burns;<br />
Sons of the Bard, my heart still mourns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sorrow true;<br />
And more would grieve, but that it turns<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trembling to you!</p>
<p class="poetry">Through twilight shades of good and ill<br />
Ye now are panting up life&rsquo;s hill,<br />
And more than common strength and skill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Must ye display;<br />
If ye would give the better will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its lawful sway.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hath Nature strung your nerves to bear<br />
Intemperance with less harm, beware!<br />
But if the Poet&rsquo;s wit ye share,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like him can speed<br />
The social hour&mdash;of tenfold care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be need;</p>
<p class="poetry">For honest men delight will take<br />
To spare your failings for his sake,<br />
<!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>Will flatter you,&mdash;and fool and rake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your steps pursue;<br />
And of your Father&rsquo;s name will make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A snare for you.</p>
<p class="poetry">Far from their noisy haunts retire,<br />
And add your voices to the quire<br />
That sanctify the cottage fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With service meet;<br />
There seek the genius of your Sire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His spirit greet;</p>
<p class="poetry">Or where, &rsquo;mid &lsquo;lonely heights and
hows,&rsquo;<br />
He paid to Nature tuneful vows;<br />
Or wiped his honourable brows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bedewed with toil,<br />
While reapers strove, or busy ploughs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upturned the soil;</p>
<p class="poetry">His judgment with benignant ray<br />
Shall guide, his fancy cheer, your way;<br />
But ne&rsquo;er to a seductive lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let faith be given;<br />
Nor deem that &lsquo;light which leads astray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is light from Heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Let no mean hope your souls enslave;<br />
Be independent, generous, brave;<br />
Your Father such example gave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such revere;<br />
But be admonished by his grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And think, and fear!</p>
<p>Two other Poems on the same subject may fitly be inserted in
this place, though, as appears from the Poet&rsquo;s notes, one
of them at least belongs to a later date.</p>
<h3>AT THE GRAVE OF BURNS. 1803.<br />
<span class="smcap">seven years after his death</span>.</h3>
<p class="poetry">I shiver, Spirit fierce and bold,<br />
At thoughts of what I now behold:<br />
<!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>As vapours breathed from dungeons cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strike pleasure dead,<br />
So sadness comes from out the mould<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Burns is laid.</p>
<p class="poetry">And have I then thy bones so near,<br />
And thou forbidden to appear?<br />
As if it were thyself that&rsquo;s here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shrink with pain;<br />
And both my wishes and my fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alike are vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">Off weight&mdash;nor press on
weight!&mdash;away<br />
Dark thoughts!&mdash;they came, but not to stay;<br />
With chastened feelings would I pay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tribute due<br />
To him, and aught that hides his clay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From mortal view.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fresh as the flower, whose modest worth<br />
He sang, his genius &lsquo;glinted&rsquo; forth,<br />
Rose like a star that touching earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For so it seems,<br />
Doth glorify its humble birth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With matchless beams.</p>
<p class="poetry">The piercing eye, the thoughtful brow,<br />
The struggling heart, where be they now?&mdash;<br />
Full soon the Aspirant of the plough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prompt, the brave,<br />
Slept, with the obscurest, in the low<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And silent grave.</p>
<p class="poetry">I mourned with thousands, but as one<br />
More deeply grieved, for He was gone<br />
Whose light I hailed when first it shone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And showed my youth<br />
How Verse may build a princely throne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On humble truth.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! where&rsquo;er the current tends,<br />
Regret pursues and with it blends,&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 280--><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Skiddaw seen,<br />
Neighbours we were, and loving friends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might have been;</p>
<p class="poetry">True friends though diversely inclined;<br />
But heart with heart and mind with mind,<br />
Where the main fibres are entwined,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Nature&rsquo;s skill,<br
/>
May even by contraries be joined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More closely still.</p>
<p class="poetry">The tear will start, and let it flow;<br />
Thou &lsquo;poor Inhabitant below,&rsquo;<br />
At this dread moment&mdash;even so&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Might we together<br />
Have sate and talked where gowans blow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or on wild heather.</p>
<p class="poetry">What treasures would have then been placed<br
/>
Within my reach; of knowledge graced<br />
By fancy what a rich repast!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why go on?&mdash;<br />
Oh! spare to sweep, thou mournful blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His grave grass-grown.</p>
<p class="poetry">There, too, a Son, his joy and pride,<br />
(Not three weeks past the Stripling died,)<br />
Lies gathered to his Father&rsquo;s side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soul-moving sight!<br />
Yet one to which is not denied<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some sad delight.</p>
<p class="poetry">For <i>he</i> is safe, a quiet bed<br />
Hath early found among the dead,<br />
Harboured where none can be misled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wronged, or distrest;<br />
And surely here it may be said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That such are blest.</p>
<p class="poetry">And oh for Thee, by pitying grace<br />
Checked oft-times in a devious race.<br />
<!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>May He who halloweth the place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Man is laid,<br />
Receive thy Spirit in the embrace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For which it prayed!</p>
<p class="poetry">Sighing I turned away; but ere<br />
Night fell I heard, or seemed to hear,<br />
Music that sorrow comes not near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ritual hymn,<br />
Chanted in love that casts out fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Seraphim.</p>
<p>From the notes appended to the latest editions of
Wordsworth&rsquo;s works, it appears that the preceding poem,
&lsquo;though <i>felt</i> at the time, was not composed till many
years afterwards.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i>The Waterfall</i>, <i>Cora

<p>The following poem belongs to the series entitled <i>Memorials
of a Tour in Scotland</i>, 1814.&nbsp; It is in a later, not
better, manner than those of 1803.&nbsp; Prefixed to it in the
later editions of the Poet&rsquo;s works are these words:
&lsquo;I had seen this celebrated waterfall twice before.&nbsp;
But the feelings to which it had given birth were not expressed
till they recurred in presence of the object on this
occasion.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>COMPOSED AT CORA LINN,<br />

<h3>ADDRESS TO KILCHURN CASTLE.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Child of loud-throated War! the mountain
Stream<br />
Roars in thy hearing; but thy hour of rest<br />
Is come, and thou art silent in thy age;<br />
Save when the wind sweeps by and sounds are caught<br />
Ambiguous, neither wholly thine nor theirs.<br />
Oh! there is life that breathes not; Powers there are<br />
That touch each other to the quick in modes<br />
Which the gross world no sense hath to perceive,<br />
No soul to dream of.&nbsp; What art Thou, from care<br />
Cast off&mdash;abandoned by thy rugged Sire,<br />
Nor by soft Peace adopted; though, in place<br />
And in dimension, such that thou might&rsquo;st seem<br />
But a mere footstool to yon sovereign Lord,<br />
Huge Cruachan, (a thing that meaner hills<br />
Might crush, nor know that it had suffered harm;)<br />

Over the pomp and beauty of a scene<br />

To pay thee homage; and with these are joined,<br />
In willing admiration and respect,<br />
Two Hearts, which in thy presence might be called<br />
Youthful as Spring.&mdash;Shade of departed Power,<br />
Skeleton of unfleshed humanity,<br />
The chronicle were welcome that should call<br />
Into the compass of distinct regard<br />

<h3>THE BLIND HIGHLAND BOY.<br />
<span class="smcap">a tale told by the fireside</span>, <span
class="smcap">after returning to the vale</span><br />
<span class="smcap">of grasmere</span>.</h3>
<p>&lsquo;The story was told me by George Mackreth, for many
years parish-clerk of Grasmere.&nbsp; He had been an eye-witness
of the occurrence.&nbsp; The vessel in reality was a washing-tub,
which the little fellow had met with on the shore of the
loch.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Now we are tired of boisterous joy,<br />
Have romped enough, my little Boy!<br />
Jane hangs her head upon my breast,<br />
And you shall bring your stool and rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This corner is your own.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>There! take your seat, and let me
see<br />
That you can listen quietly:<br />
And, as I promised, I will tell<br />
That strange adventure which befel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A poor blind Highland Boy.</p>
<p class="poetry">A <i>Highland</i> Boy!&mdash;why call him
so?<br />
Because, my Darlings, ye must know<br />
That, under hills which rise like towers,<br />
Far higher hills than these of ours!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He from his birth had lived.</p>
<p class="poetry">He ne&rsquo;er had seen one earthly sight,<br
/>
The sun, the day; the stars, the night;<br />
Or tree, or butterfly, or flower,<br />
Or fish in stream, or bird in bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or woman, man, or child.</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet he neither drooped nor pined,<br />
Nor had a melancholy mind;<br />
For God took pity on the Boy,<br />
And was his friend; and gave him joy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of which we nothing know.</p>
<p class="poetry">His Mother, too, no doubt, above<br />
Her other children him did love:<br />
For, was she here, or was she there,<br />
She thought of him with constant care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And more than mother&rsquo;s
love.</p>
<p class="poetry">And proud she was of heart, when clad<br />
In crimson stockings, tartan plaid,<br />
And bonnet with a feather gay,<br />
To Kirk he on the sabbath day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went hand in hand with her.</p>
<p class="poetry">A dog too, had he; not for need,<br />
But one to play with and to feed;<br />
Which would have led him, if bereft<br />
Of company or friends, and left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a better guide.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>And then the bagpipes he could
blow&mdash;<br />
And thus from house to house would go;<br />
And all were pleased to hear and see,<br />
For none made sweeter melody<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than did the poor blind Boy.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet he had many a restless dream;<br />
Both when he heard the eagles scream,<br />
And when he heard the torrents roar,<br />
And heard the water beat the shore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near which their cottage
stood.</p>
<p class="poetry">Beside a lake their cottage stood,<br />
Not small like ours, a peaceful flood;<br />
But one of mighty size, and strange;<br />
That, rough or smooth, is full of change,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stirring in its bed.</p>
<p class="poetry">For to this lake, by night and day,<br />
The great Sea-water finds its way<br />
Through long, long windings of the hills<br />
And drinks up all the pretty rills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And rivers large and strong:</p>
<p class="poetry">Then hurries back the road it came&mdash;<br />
Returns, on errand still the same;<br />
This did it when the earth was new;<br />
And this for evermore will do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as earth shall last.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, with the coming of the tide,<br />
Come boats and ships that safely ride<br />
Between the woods and lofty rocks;<br />
And to the shepherds with their flocks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring tales of distant lands.</p>
<p class="poetry">And of those tales, whate&rsquo;er they
were,<br />
The blind Boy always had his share;<br />
Whether of mighty towns, or vales<br />
With warmer suns and softer gales,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or wonders of the Deep.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>Yet more it pleased him, more it
stirred,<br />
When from the water-side he heard<br />
The shouting, and the jolly cheers;<br />
The bustle of the mariners<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In stillness or in storm.</p>
<p class="poetry">But what do his desires avail?<br />
For He must never handle sail;<br />
Nor mount the mast, nor row, nor float<br />
In sailor&rsquo;s ship, or fisher&rsquo;s boat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the rocking waves.</p>
<p class="poetry">His Mother often thought, and said,<br />
What sin would be upon her head<br />
If she should suffer this: &lsquo;My Son,<br />
Whate&rsquo;er you do, leave this undone;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The danger is so great.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus lived he by Loch-Leven&rsquo;s side<br />
Still sounding with the sounding tide,<br />
And heard the billows leap and dance,<br />
Without a shadow of mischance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he was ten years old.</p>
<p class="poetry">When one day (and now mark me well,<br />
Ye soon shall know how this befel)<br />
He in a vessel of his own,<br />
On the swift flood is hurrying down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down to the mighty Sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">In such a vessel never more<br />
May human creature leave the shore!<br />
If this or that way he should stir,<br />
Woe to the poor blind Mariner!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For death will be his doom.</p>
<p class="poetry">But say what bears him?&mdash;Ye have seen<br
/>
The Indian&rsquo;s bow, his arrows keen,<br />
Rare beasts, and birds with plumage bright;<br />
Gifts which, for wonder or delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are brought in ships from far.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Such gifts had those seafaring
men<br />
Spread round that haven in the glen;<br />
Each hut, perchance, might have its own,<br />
And to the Boy they all were known&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew and prized them all.</p>
<p class="poetry">The rarest was a Turtle-shell<br />
Which he, poor Child, had studied well;<br />
A shell of ample size, and light<br />
As the pearly car of Amphitrite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sportive dolphins drew.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, as a Coracle that braves<br />
On Vaga&rsquo;s breast the fretful waves,<br />
This shell upon the deep would swim,<br />
And gaily lift its fearless brim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the tossing surge.</p>
<p class="poetry">And this the little blind Boy knew:<br />
And he a story strange yet true<br />
Had heard, how in a shell like this<br />
An English Boy, O thought of bliss!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had stoutly launched from
shore;</p>
<p class="poetry">Launched from the margin of a bay<br />
Among the Indian isles, where lay<br />
His father&rsquo;s ship, and had sailed far&mdash;<br />
To join that gallant ship of war,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his delightful shell.</p>
<p class="poetry">Our Highland Boy oft visited<br />
The house that held this prize; and, led<br />
By choice or chance, did thither come<br />
One day when no one was at home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And found the door unbarred.</p>
<p class="poetry">While there he sate, alone and blind,<br />
That story flashed upon his mind;&mdash;<br />
A bold thought roused him, and he took<br />
The shell from out its secret nook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bore it on his head.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>He launched his vessel,&mdash;and in
pride<br />
Of spirit, from Loch-Leven&rsquo;s side,<br />
Stepped into it&mdash;his thoughts all free<br />
As the light breezes that with glee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sang through the
adventurer&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p class="poetry">A while he stood upon his feet;<br />
He felt the motion&mdash;took his seat;<br />
Still better pleased as more and more<br />
The tide retreated from the shore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sucked, and sucked him in.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there he is in face of Heaven.<br />
How rapidly the Child is driven!<br />
The fourth part of a mile, I ween,<br />
He thus had gone, ere he was seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By any human eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when he was first seen, oh me,<br />
What shrieking and what misery!<br />
For many saw; among the rest<br />
His Mother, she who loved him best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw her poor blind Boy.</p>
<p class="poetry">But for the child, the sightless Boy,<br />
It is the triumph of his joy!<br />
The bravest traveller in balloon,<br />
Mounting as if to reach the moon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was never half so blessed.</p>
<p class="poetry">And let him, let him go his way,<br />
Alone, and innocent, and gay!<br />
For, if good Angels love to wait<br />
On the forlorn unfortunate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Child will take no harm.</p>
<p class="poetry">But now the passionate lament,<br />
Which from the crowd on shore was sent,<br />
The cries which broke from old and young<br />
In Gaelic, or the English tongue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are stifled&mdash;all is
still.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 292--><a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>And quickly with a silent crew,<br
/>
A boat is ready to pursue;<br />
And from the shore their course they take,<br />
And swiftly down the running lake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They follow the blind Boy.</p>
<p class="poetry">But soon they move with softer pace;<br />
So have ye seen the fowler chase<br />
On Grasmere&rsquo;s clear unruffled breast<br />
A youngling of the wild-duck&rsquo;s nest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With deftly-lifted oar;</p>
<p class="poetry">Or as the wily sailors crept<br />
To seize (while on the Deep it slept)<br />
The hapless creature which did dwell<br />
Erewhile within the dancing shell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They steal upon their prey.</p>
<p class="poetry">With sound the least that can be made,<br />
They follow, more and more afraid,<br />
More cautious as they draw more near;<br />
But in his darkness he can hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And guesses their intent.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Lei-gha&mdash;Lei-gha&rsquo;&mdash;he
then cried out,<br />
&lsquo;Lei-gha&mdash;Lei-gha&rsquo;&mdash;with eager shout;<br />
Thus did he cry, and thus did pray,<br />
And what he meant was, &lsquo;Keep away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And leave me to myself!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! and when he felt their hands&mdash;<br />
You&rsquo;ve often heard of magic wands,<br />
That with a motion overthrow<br />
A palace of the proudest show,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or melt it into air:</p>
<p class="poetry">So all his dreams&mdash;that inward light<br />
With which his soul had shone so bright&mdash;<br />
All vanished;&mdash;&rsquo;twas a heart-felt cross<br />
To him, a heavy, bitter loss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he had ever known.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>But hark! a gratulating voice,<br />
With which the very hills rejoice:<br />
&rsquo;Tis from the crowd, who tremblingly<br />
Have watched the event, and now can see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he is safe at last.</p>
<p class="poetry">And then, when he was brought to land,<br />
Full sure they were a happy band,<br />
Which, gathering round, did on the banks<br />
Of that great Water give God thanks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And welcomed the poor Child.</p>
<p class="poetry">And in the general joy of heart<br />
The blind Boy&rsquo;s little dog took part;<br />
He leapt about, and oft did kiss<br />
His master&rsquo;s hands in sign of bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sound like lamentation.</p>
<p class="poetry">But most of all, his Mother dear,<br />
She who had fainted with her fear,<br />
Rejoiced when waking she espies<br />
The Child; when she can trust her eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And touches the blind Boy.</p>
<p class="poetry">She led him home, and wept amain,<br />
When he was in the house again:<br />
Tears flowed in torrents from her eyes;<br />
She kissed him&mdash;how could she chastise?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was too happy far.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus, after he had fondly braved<br />
The perilous Deep, the Boy was saved;<br />
And, though his fancies had been wild,<br />
Yet he was pleased and reconciled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To live in peace on shore.</p>
<p class="poetry">And in the lonely Highland dell<br />
Still do they keep the Turtle-shell;<br />
And long the story will repeat<br />
Of the blind Boy&rsquo;s adventurous feat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how he was preserved.</p>

On tombs, with palms together prest,<br />
But sculptured out of living stone,<br />

Both hands with rival energy<br />
Employed in setting his sword free<br />
From its dull sheath&mdash;stern sentinel<br />
Intent to guard St. Robert&rsquo;s cell;<br />
As if with memory of the affray<br />
Far distant, when, as legends say,<br />
The Monks of Fountain&rsquo;s thronged to force<br />
From its dear home the Hermit&rsquo;s corse,<br />
That in their keeping it might lie,<br />
To crown their abbey&rsquo;s sanctity.<br />

Where altar-stone and rock-hewn seat<br />

Defeating, put the Monks to shame,<br />

Bare to the sky, with threatening brand<br />

Reflected in the pool below.</p>

To seize whate&rsquo;er, through misty air,<br />
A ghost, by glimpses, may present<br />

And give the phantom an array<br />

An Ossian out of mural rock,<br />
And leave the figurative Man&mdash;<br />
Upon thy margin, roaring Bran!&mdash;<br />
Fixed like the Templar of the steep,<br />
An everlasting watch to keep;<br />
With local sanctities in trust,<br />
More precious than a hermit&rsquo;s dust;<br />
And virtues through the mass infused,<br />
Which old idolatry abused.</p>

deny<br />
All fervour to the sightless eye;<br />
And touch from rising suns in vain<br />

Towers rent, winds combating with woods,<br />
Lands deluged by unbridled floods;<br />
And beast and bird that from the spell<br />
Of sleep took import terrible;&mdash;<br />
These types mysterious (if the show<br />
Of battle and the routed foe<br />
Had failed) would furnish an array<br />
Of matter for the dawning day!</p>

toad,<br />
Inheritors of his abode;<br />
The otter crouching undisturbed,<br />
In her dark cleft;&mdash;but be thou curbed,<br />
O froward Fancy! &rsquo;mid a scene<br />
Of aspect winning and serene;<br />
For those offensive creatures shun<br />
The inquisition of the sun!<br />
And in this region flowers delight,<br />
And all is lovely to the sight.</p>

<p class="poetry">Spring finds not here a melancholy breast,<br

When she applies her annual test<br />
To dead and living; when her breath<br />
Quickens, as now, the withered heath;&mdash;<br />
Nor flaunting Summer&mdash;when he throws<br />
His soul into the briar-rose;<br />
Or calls the lily from her sleep<br />
Prolonged beneath the bordering deep;<br />

Young Bacchus was conveyed&mdash;to lie<br />
Safe from his step-dame Rhea&rsquo;s eye;<br />
Where bud, and bloom, and fruitage, glowed,<br />

A foil to his celestial cheek!</p>

<p>In the <i>Tour in Scotland</i>, 1814, the Poet
writes:&mdash;&lsquo;I seldom read or think of this Poem without
regretting that my dear sister was not of the party, as she would
have had so much delight in recalling the time when travelling
together in Scotland we declined going in search of this
celebrated stream.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>YARROW VISITED,<br />
<span class="smcap">September</span> 1814.</h3>
<p class="poetry">And is this&mdash;Yarrow?&mdash;<i>This</i> the
Stream<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of which my fancy cherished,<br />
So faithfully, a waking dream?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An image that hath perished!<br />
O that some Minstrel&rsquo;s harp were near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To utter notes of gladness,<br />
And chase this silence from the air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fills my heart with sadness!</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet why?&mdash;a silvery current flows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With uncontrolled meanderings;<br />
Nor have these eyes by greener hills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Been soothed, in all my wanderings.<br />

302</span>And, through her depths, St. Mary&rsquo;s Lake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is visibly delighted;<br />
For not a feature of those hills<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is in the mirror slighted.</p>
<p class="poetry">A blue sky bends o&rsquo;er Yarrow vale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save where that pearly whiteness<br />
Is round the rising sun diffused<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tender hazy brightness;<br />
Mild dawn of promise! that excludes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All profitless dejection;<br />
Though not unwilling here to admit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A pensive recollection.</p>
<p class="poetry">Where was it that the famous Flower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Yarrow Vale lay bleeding?<br />
His bed perchance was yon smooth mound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On which the herd is feeding:<br />
And haply from this crystal pool,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now peaceful as the morning,<br />
The Water-wraith ascended thrice&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave his doleful warning.</p>
<p class="poetry">Delicious is the Lay that sings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The haunts of happy Lovers,<br />
The path that leads them to the grove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The leafy grove that covers:<br />
And Pity sanctifies the Verse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That paints, by strength of sorrow,<br />
The unconquerable strength of love;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bear witness, rueful Yarrow!</p>
<p class="poetry">But thou, that didst appear so fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fond imagination,<br />
Dost rival in the light of day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her delicate creation:<br />
Meek loveliness is round thee spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A softness still and holy;<br />
The grace of forest charms decayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pastoral melancholy.</p>
<p class="poetry">That region left, the vale unfolds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich groves of lofty stature,<br />
<!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Of cultivated nature;<br />
And, rising from those lofty groves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold a Ruin hoary!<br />
The shattered front of Newark&rsquo;s Towers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Renowned in Border story.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fair scenes for childhood&rsquo;s opening
bloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For sportive youth to stray in;<br />
For manhood to enjoy his strength;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And age to wear away in!<br />
Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A covert for protection<br />
Of tender thoughts, that nestle there&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The brood of chaste affection.</p>
<p class="poetry">How sweet, on this autumnal day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wild-wood fruits to gather,<br />
And on my True-love&rsquo;s forehead plant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A crest of blooming heather!<br />
And what if I enwreathed my own!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere no offence to reason;<br />
The sober Hills thus deck their brows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet the wintry season.</p>
<p class="poetry">I see&mdash;but not by sight alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loved Yarrow, have I won thee;<br />
A ray of fancy still survives&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her sunshine plays upon thee!<br />
Thy ever-youthful waters keep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A course of lively pleasure;<br />
And gladsome notes my lips can breathe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordant to the measure.</p>
<p class="poetry">The vapours linger round the Heights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They melt, and soon must vanish;<br />
One hour is theirs, nor more is mine&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad thoughts, which I would banish,<br />
But that I know, where&rsquo;er I go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy genuine image, Yarrow!<br />
Will dwell with me&mdash;to heighten joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cheer my mind in sorrow.</p>

304</span>It may interest many to read Wordsworth&rsquo;s own
comment on the two following poems.&nbsp; &lsquo;On Tuesday
morning,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;Sir Walter Scott accompanied us
and most of the party to Newark Castle, on the Yarrow.&nbsp; When
we alighted from the carriages he walked pretty stoutly, and had
great pleasure in revisiting there his favourite haunts.&nbsp; Of
that excursion the verses &ldquo;Yarrow Revisited&rdquo; are a
memorial.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the romance that pervades Sir
Walter&rsquo;s works, and attaches to many of his habits, there
is too much pressure of fact for these verses to harmonize, as
much as I could wish, with the two preceding poems.&nbsp; On our
return in the afternoon, we had to cross the Tweed, directly
opposite Abbotsford.&nbsp; The wheels of our carriage grated upon
the pebbles in the bed of the stream, that there flows somewhat
rapidly.&nbsp; A rich but sad light, of rather a purple than a
golden hue, was spread over the Eildon Hills at that moment; and
thinking it probable that it might be the last time Sir Walter
would cross the stream, I was not a little moved, and expressed
some of my feelings in the sonnet beginning</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;A trouble not of clouds,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>At noon on Thursday we left Abbotsford, and on the morning of
that day Sir Walter and I had a serious conversation,
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, when he spoke with
gratitude of the happy life which, upon the whole, he had
led.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&lsquo;In this interview also it was, that, upon my expressing
a hope of his health being benefited by the climate of the
country to which he was going, and by the interest he would take
in the classic remembrances of Italy, he made use of the
quotation from &ldquo;Yarrow Unvisited,&rdquo; as recorded by me
in the &ldquo;Musings near Aquapendente,&rdquo; six years
afterwards. . . .&nbsp; Both the &ldquo;Yarrow Revisited&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Sonnet&rdquo; were sent him before his departure
from England.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>YARROW REVISITED.</h3>
<p class="poetry">The gallant Youth, who may have gained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or seeks, a &lsquo;winsome Marrow,&rsquo;<br />
Was but an Infant in the lap<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When first I looked on Yarrow;<br />
Once more, by Newark&rsquo;s Castle-gate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Long left without a warder,<br />
I stood, looked, listened, and with Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Great Minstrel of the Border!</p>
<p class="poetry">Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dignity installing<br />
In gentle bosoms, while sere leaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were on the bough, or falling;<br />
<!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The forest to embolden;<br />
Reddened the fiery hues, and shot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Transparence through the golden.</p>
<p class="poetry">For busy thoughts the Stream flowed on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In foamy agitation;<br />
And slept in many a crystal pool<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For quiet contemplation:<br />
No public and no private care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The freeborn mind enthralling,<br />
We made a day of happy hours,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our happy days recalling.</p>
<p class="poetry">Brisk Youth appeared, the Morn of youth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With freaks of graceful folly,&mdash;<br />
Life&rsquo;s temperate Noon, her sober Eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Night not melancholy;<br />
Past, present, future, all appeared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In harmony united,<br />
Like guests that meet, and some from far,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By cordial love invited.</p>
<p class="poetry">And if, as Yarrow, through the woods<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And down the meadow ranging,<br />
Did meet us with unaltered face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though we were changed and changing;<br />
If, <i>then</i>, some natural shadows spread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our inward prospect over,<br />
The soul&rsquo;s deep valley was not slow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its brightness to recover.</p>
<p class="poetry">Eternal blessings on the Muse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her divine employment!<br />
The blameless Muse, who trains her Sons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For hope and calm enjoyment;<br />
Albeit sickness, lingering yet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has o&rsquo;er their pillow brooded;<br />
And Care waylays their steps&mdash;a Sprite<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not easily eluded.</p>

For mild Sorento&rsquo;s breezy waves;<br />

With native Fancy her fresh aid,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; In Yarrow&rsquo;s groves were centred;<br />
Who through the silent portal arch<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Too timidly was mounted<br />
By the &lsquo;last Minstrel,&rsquo; (not the last!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere he his Tale recounted.</p>
<p class="poetry">Flow on for ever, Yarrow Stream!<br />

Well pleased that future Bards should chant<br />

<h3>ON THE DEPARTURE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT FROM<br />
ABBOTSFORD FOR NAPLES.</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trouble, not of clouds, or
weeping rain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor of the setting sun&rsquo;s pathetic light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Engendered, hangs o&rsquo;er Eildon&rsquo;s triple
height:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirits of Power, assembled there, complain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For kindred Power departing from their sight;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe
strain,<br />
Saddens his voice again, and yet again.</p>

<h3>THE TROSSACHS.</h3>
<p>[Compare with this Sonnet the poem composed about thirty years
earlier on nearly the same spot of ground, &lsquo;What! you are
stepping westward?&rsquo;&nbsp; (See p. 221.)&nbsp; This earlier
poem, one of the most truly ethereal and ideal Wordsworth ever
wrote, is filled with the overflowing spirit of life and
hope.&nbsp; In every line of it we feel the exulting pulse of
the</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;traveller
through the world that lay<br />
Before him on his endless way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The later one is stilled down to perfect autumnal quiet.&nbsp;
There is in it the chastened pensiveness of one to whom all
things now</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;do
take a sober colouring from an eye<br />
That hath kept watch o&rsquo;er man&rsquo;s mortality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the sadness has at the heart of it peaceful hope.&nbsp;
This is Wordsworth&rsquo;s own comment:&mdash;&lsquo;As recorded
in my sister&rsquo;s Journal, I had first seen the Trossachs in
her and Coleridge&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; The sentiment that runs
through this sonnet was natural to the season in which I again
visited this beautiful spot; but this and some other sonnets that
follow were coloured by the remembrance of my recent visit to Sir
Walter Scott, and the melancholy errand on which he was
going.&rsquo;]</p>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s not a nook within this solemn
Pass,<br />
But were an apt confessional for One<br />
Taught by his summer spent, his autumn gone,<br />
That Life is but a tale of morning grass<br />
Withered at eve.&nbsp; From scenes of art which chase<br />
That thought away, turn, and with watchful eyes<br />
Feed it &rsquo;mid Nature&rsquo;s old felicities,<br />
Rocks, rivers, and smooth lakes more clear than glass<br />
Untouched, unbreathed upon.&nbsp; Thrice happy quest,<br />
If from a golden perch of aspen spray<br />
(October&rsquo;s workmanship to rival May)<br />
The pensive warbler of the ruddy breast<br />
That moral sweeten by a heaven-taught lay,<br />
Lulling the year, with all its cares, to rest!</p>

<p>James Hatfield, indicted for having, in the Lake district,
under the assumed name of Hon. Alexander Augustus Hope, brother
of the Earl of Hopetoun, forged certain bills of exchange.&nbsp;
He was condemned to death at Carlisle on August 16, 1803.&nbsp;
His atrocious treatment of a beautiful girl, known in the
district as &lsquo;Mary of Buttermere,&rsquo; had drawn more than
usual attention to the criminal.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Brother John&rsquo; here alluded to was a
sailor.&nbsp; He was about two years and eight months younger
than the poet, who found in him quite a congenial spirit.&nbsp;
He perished, with nearly all his crew, in the &lsquo;Earl of
Abergavenny,&rsquo; East-Indiaman, which he commanded, and which,
owing to the incompetency of a pilot, was in his last outward
voyage wrecked on the Shambles of the Bill of Portland on the
night of Friday, February 5, 1805.&nbsp; His brother William
speaks of him in verse, as &lsquo;a silent poet,&rsquo; and in
prose describes him as &lsquo;meek, affectionate, silently
enthusiastic, loving all quiet things, and a poet in everything
but words.&rsquo;&nbsp; Allusions to this sailor-brother occur in
several of the poems, as in those lines beginning &lsquo;When to
the attractions of the busy world,&rsquo; to be found among the
&lsquo;Poems on the Naming of Places,&rsquo; also in the
&lsquo;Elegiac Stanzas suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in
a Storm,&rsquo; and in other poems.</p>

<p>The following account of this library is taken from Dr. John
Brown&rsquo;s delightful tract, <i>The Enterkin</i>.&nbsp; The
author will excuse wholesale appropriation to illustrate a
journal which, I believe, will be dear to him, and to all who
feel as he does:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The miners at Leadhills are a reading, a
hard-reading people; and to any one looking into the catalogue of
their &ldquo;Reading Society,&rdquo; selected by the men
themselves for their own uses and tastes, this will be
manifest.&nbsp; We have no small gratification in holding their
diploma of honorary membership&mdash;signed by the preses and
clerk, and having the official seal, significant of the craft of
the place&mdash;of this, we venture to say, one of the oldest and
best village-libraries in the kingdom, having been founded in
1741, when the worthy miners of that day, headed by James Wells
and clerked by William Wright, did, on the 23d November,
&ldquo;condescend upon certain articles and laws&rdquo;&mdash;as
grave and thorough as if they were the constitution of a
commonwealth, and as sturdily independent as if no Earl were
their superior and master.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is hereby declared
that no right is hereby given, nor shall at any time be given, to
the said Earl of Hopetoun, or his aforesaids, or to any person or
persons whatever, of disposing of any books or other effects
whatever belonging to the Society, nor of taking any concern with
the Society&rsquo;s affairs,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; As an indication
of the wild region and the distances travelled, one of the rules
is, &ldquo;that every member not residing in Leadhills shall be
provided with a bag sufficient to keep out the rain.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here is the stiff, covenanting dignity cropping
out&mdash;&ldquo;Every member shall (at the annual meeting)
deliver what he hath to say to the preses; and if two or more
members attempt to speak at a time, the preses shall determine
who shall speak first;&rdquo; and &ldquo;members guilty of
indecency, or unruly, obstinate behaviour&rdquo; are to be
punished &ldquo;by fine, suspension, or exclusion, according to
the nature of the transgression.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Westminster
Divines could not have made a tighter job.&rsquo;</p>

laugh</i>.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> 41.</p>
<p>Joanna Hutchinson, Mrs. Wordsworth&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; Among
the &lsquo;Poems on the Naming of Places&rsquo; is one addressed
to her, in 1800, in which the following well-known lines
occur:&mdash;</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;As
it befel,<br />
One summer morning we had walked abroad<br />
At break of day, Joanna and myself.<br />
&mdash;&rsquo;Twas that delightful season when the broom,<br />
Full-flowered, and visible on every steep,<br />
Along the copses runs in veins of gold.<br />
Our pathway led us on to Rotha&rsquo;s banks,<br />
And when we came in front of that tall rock<br />
That eastward looks, I there stopped short and stood<br />
Tracing the lofty barrier with my eye<br />
From base to summit; such delight I found<br />
To note in shrub and tree, in stone and flower<br />
That intermixture of delicious hues,<br />
Along so vast a surface, all at once,<br />
In one impression, by connecting force<br />
Of their own beauty, imaged in the heart.<br />
&mdash;When I had gazed perhaps two minutes&rsquo; space,<br />
Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld<br />
That ravishment of mine, and laughed aloud;<br />
The Rock, like something starting from a sleep,<br />
Took up the Lady&rsquo;s voice and laughed again;<br />
That ancient woman seated on Helm Crag<br />
Was ready with her cavern; Hammarscar,<br />
And the tall Steep of Silverhaw, sent forth<br />
A noise of laughter; southern Loughrigg heard,<br />
And Fairfield answered with a mountain tone;<br />
Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky<br />
Carried the Lady&rsquo;s voice,&mdash;old Skiddaw blew<br />
His speaking-trumpet;&mdash;back out of the clouds<br />
<!-- page 312--><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
312</span>Of Glaramara southward came the voice;<br />
And Kirkstone tossed it from his misty head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his comments made on his Poems late in life, Wordsworth
said of this one:&mdash;&lsquo;The effect of her laugh is an
extravagance; though the effect of the reverberation of voices in
some parts of the mountains is very striking.&nbsp; There is, in
the &ldquo;Excursion,&rdquo; an allusion to the bleat of a lamb
thus re-echoed, and described without any exaggeration, as I
heard it, on the side of Stickle Tarn, from the precipice that

<p>&lsquo;When I wrote this account of the village of Luss, I
fully believed I had a perfect recollection of the two bells, as
I have described them; but I am half tempted to think they have
been a creation of my own fancy, though no image that I know I
have actually seen is at this day more vividly impressed upon my
mind.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>MS. note</i>, <i>Author</i>, 1806.</p>

<p>The writer, inhospitably as she had been treated, was more
fortunate than a distinguished French traveller, who arrived at
Luss at night, a few years earlier.&nbsp; The hostess made signs
to him that he should not speak, hustled him into a stable, and
said solemnly, &lsquo;The Justiciary Lords do me the honour to
lodge here when they are on this circuit.&nbsp; There is one of
them here at present.&nbsp; He is asleep, and nobody must disturb
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; And forthwith she drove him out into the rain
and darkness, saying, &lsquo;How can I help it?&nbsp; Make no
noise, his Lordship must not be disturbed.&nbsp; Every one should
pay respect to the law.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp;

of our friend whom we had met at Loch Lomond, and we found that
it was the same person.&nbsp; He was the brother of the Lady of
Glengyle, who had made a gentleman of him by new-clothing him
from head to foot.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the ferryman,
&ldquo;when the clothes are worn out, and his sister is tired of
supplying him with pocket-money (which will probably be very
soon), he will be obliged to betake himself again to
America.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Lady of Glengyle has a house not far
from the ferry-house, but she now lives mostly at Callander for
the sake of educating her son.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Author&rsquo;s

100.</p>
<p>The world believes, and will continue to believe, that Scott
was the first &lsquo;Sassenach&rsquo; who discovered the
Trossachs, as it was his Poem which gave them world-wide
celebrity.&nbsp; It would probably be as impossible to alter this
impression, as it would be to substitute for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Macbeth and Lady Macbeth the very different versions of the facts
and characters which historical research has brought to
light.&nbsp; And yet it would be interesting, to those who care
for truth and fact, to inquire, did time allow, what first
brought the Trossachs into notice, and who first did so.&nbsp;
That they had, as I have said in the Preface, some fame before
Scott&rsquo;s Poem appeared, is clear, else a stranger like
Wordsworth would never have gone so far out of his way to search
for them.&nbsp; Pending a thorough examination of the question,
it may be worth while here to note the following facts.&nbsp;
Miss Wordsworth refers in the text to some work on the Trossachs,
from which the words at the head of this note are taken.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that the work referred to was the
well-known &lsquo;Sketches descriptive of Picturesque Scenery on
the Southern Confines of Perthshire,&rsquo; by the Rev. Patrick
Graham, minister of Aberfoyle, but it is satisfactory to find
that Mr. Graham was not alone in his admiration of Highland
scenery in those early days.&nbsp; A neighbour of his, the Rev.
James Robertson, who was presented to the parish of Callander in
1768, wrote a description of the Trossachs in Sir John
Sinclair&rsquo;s Statistical Account, and from the fact of his
using the very sentence quoted by Miss Wordsworth, I have no
doubt he was the author of the <!-- page 314--><a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>little
pamphlet.&nbsp; Miss Spence in her &lsquo;Caledonian
Excursion,&rsquo; 1811, says that the Honourable Mrs. Murray told
the minister of Callander that Scott ought to have dedicated
&lsquo;The Lady of the Lake&rsquo; to her as the discoverer of
the Trossachs&mdash;&lsquo;Pray, Madam,&rsquo; said the good
doctor, &lsquo;when did you write your Tour?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;In the year 1794.&rsquo; <a name="citation314"></a><a
href="#footnote314" class="citation">[314]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Then,
Madam, it is no presumption in me to consider that I was the
person who in 1790 made the Trossachs first known, for except to
the natives and a few individuals in this neighbourhood, this
remarkable place had never been heard of.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Robertson died in 1812.&nbsp; There were thus at least two
notices of the Trossachs published before Mr. Graham&rsquo;s
Sketches: these were not published till 1806.&nbsp; <i>The Lady
of the Lake</i> was first published in 1810.</p>
<p><a name="footnote101"></a><a href="#citation101"

11.&mdash;&lsquo;Dutch myrtle.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Page</span> 101.</p>
<p>This seems to be the name by which Miss Wordsworth knew the
plant which Lowlanders generally call <i>bog myrtle</i>, Border
men <i>gale</i>, or <i>sweet gale</i>, and Highlanders
<i>roid</i> (pronounced as <i>roitch</i>).&nbsp; Botanists, I
believe, know it as <i>Myrica Gale</i>, a most fragrant plant or
shrub, growing generally in moist and mossy ground.&nbsp; Perhaps
nothing more surely brings back the feeling that you are in the
very Highlands than the first scent of this plant caught on the
breeze.</p>

12.&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Bonnier than Loch
Lomond</i>.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> 116.</p>
<p>As an illustration of local jealousy, I may mention that when
Mr. Jamieson, the editor of the fifth edition of Burt&rsquo;s
Letters, was in the Highlands in 1814, four years after the
publication of Scott&rsquo;s Poem, and eleven after the
Wordsworths&rsquo; visit, he met a savage-looking fellow on the
top of Ben Lomond, the image of &lsquo;Red Murdoch,&rsquo; who
told him that he had been a guide to the mountain for more than
forty years, but now &lsquo;a Walter Scott&rsquo; had spoiled his
trade.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I had him in a
ferry over Loch Lomond; I should be after sinking the boat, if I
drowned myself into the bargain, for ever since he wrote his
&ldquo;Lady of the Lake,&rdquo; as they call it, everybody goes
to see that filthy hole, Loch Ketterine.&nbsp; The devil confound
his ladies and his lakes!&rsquo;</p>

14.&mdash;&lsquo;<i>The woman said it had been a
palace</i>.&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Page</span> 196.</p>
<p>A mistake.&nbsp; The old mansion here described was the
building formerly used as a prison-house of the Regality of
Athole in which the Dukes, and formerly the Earls, of Athole
confined their criminals during the ages when they, in common
with all the other Scottish Barons, exercised the right of
heritable jurisdiction.&nbsp; This right was abolished after the
&rsquo;45, and then this, like all other baronial prison-houses,
fell into disuse and decay.&nbsp; Nearly entire seventy years
ago, it has now wholly disappeared, having been used up, no
doubt, as material for the neighbouring buildings.&nbsp; There
was, however, at Logierait, a Royal Castle, from which the place
itself and the large adjacent parish take their
name&mdash;Lag-an-raith, the hollow of the Castle,&mdash;while
the neighbouring small hamlet and railway station on the other
side of the Tummel are called Balla-na-luig&mdash;the town of the
hollow.&nbsp; The Castle stood on a high knoll overlooking the
church and inn of Logierait, commanding a view of the junction of
the Tummel and the Tay immediately underneath, and of the whole
of southern Athole, as far as Dunkeld.&nbsp; This knoll is now
crowned by a high Celtic cross, memorial of the late Duke of
Athole.&nbsp; <!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>Immediately around it are seen lying
here and there blocks of solid masonry, the sole remnants of the
Castle in which Robert II. is said to have dwelt during his
visits to Athole.&nbsp; Traces of the Castle moat are still
discernible.</p>

<p>Regarding this Wordsworth says, &lsquo;I have since been told
that I was misinformed as to the burial-place of Rob Roy; if so,
I may plead in excuse that I wrote on apparent good authority,
namely, that of a well-educated lady who lived at the head of the
lake, within a mile or less of the point indicated as containing
the remains of one so famous in that neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The real burial-place of Rob Roy is the Kirkton of
Balquhidder, at the lower end of Loch Voil.&nbsp; The grave is
covered by a rude grey slab, on which a long claymore is roughly
engraved.&nbsp; The Guide-book informs us that the arms on his
tombstone are a Scotch pine, the badge of Clan Gregor, crossed by
a sword, and supporting a crown, this last to denote the
relationship claimed by the Gregarach with the royal
Stuarts.&nbsp; When I last saw the tombstone, as far as I
remember, I observed nothing but the outline of the long
sword.</p>

speaks occasionally in his letters.&nbsp; &lsquo;The present Lord

his own writing.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Letter to Sir G. Beaumont</i>,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
